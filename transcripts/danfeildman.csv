KAM,It's nice to Nice to meet you
HCP,Yeah nice to meet you too
KAM,Button out the way so I can see your face
KAM," So firstly, nice to meet you, I'm Dan"
KAM," I'm one of the hospital reps in Manchester, I've worked for Pfizer for about over 20 years now"
HCP, Right
KAM,Ridiculous of where the time goes
KAM," And I've been doing lots and lots of products over the years, but mainly in cardiovascular and pain"
HCP,"Alright, okay"
KAM,"Yeah, so quite varied sort of career within Pfizer doing lots of different roles"
KAM," And obviously, appreciate having this conversation to have a little bit of googling and have a look at sort of your profile looks like you"
KAM," You know, you've done hell of a lot, a hell of a lot"
HCP,I guess
HCP," I guess I've been around a long time, Dan"
KAM,You don't look like
HCP,"This is, this is all hair dye, Dan"
HCP, I'm joking
HCP, So and and you've been working for Pfizer for a long time
KAM,"Yeah, for a long time"
KAM, Yeah
KAM, 20 years
HCP,"And this will be the biggest change in your working practice ever, I suspect"
KAM,"Well, obviously COVID is sort of made things move faster, I think from a virtual perspective"
KAM," And we could talk all day about COVID, couldn't we and how it's affecting everything"
KAM," And But yeah, I mean, I have my reservations around virtual work, I think it's I think it's good for some it's not, it's not for everybody, and it's good for some people have that option, of being able to offer that discussion at a mutually better time for a clinician, and what are your thoughts around sort of virtual and how things have changed"
HCP,"I mean, I think to some extent, it has eased the ability to get in touch with people, but that's a bad thing is known as a good thing"
HCP," Previously, you have control over my diary, and I'd say I'll meet you on Monday, in three weeks in Costa Coffee, and we'll have a coffee"
HCP," And you it's much easier to get a relationship with somebody, if you meet them face to face and physically"
KAM,"Yeah, I agree"
HCP,The day we know that relationships are what make things work
HCP," Otherwise, Boris wouldn't be going to Brussels"
KAM,Correct
HCP,A telephone call just won't do
HCP," And, and, and of course, it also disturbs it also disturbs the day more because you often say oh, you know, what is call me at 11"
HCP, And then what happens is your day is completely disrupted
HCP," whereas previously, I would not book any appointments in on a Tuesday"
HCP, And this is not meant to be relevant to today's discussion
HCP, But I would say I'm having Tuesday free and I would sit at home
HCP, And I would have no cause
HCP, I would have no meetings at all
HCP," And, and so it's much in some ways, it's much more controllable, if everything is face to face, and it's much less controllable, because you need a guy, we'll just do a quick 15 minute meeting"
HCP," But actually a 15 minute meeting takes 15 minutes beforehand, 15 minutes afterwards to be the whole hour"
HCP," And it disrupts the concentration flow and in my job because I do half time research, um, having a full morning without disturbance is useful to get you in the zone if you like"
HCP," Whereas I think, I think things are different"
HCP," And of course, the other thing is that teaching meetings are very different aren't they"
HCP, So teaching meetings are faster
HCP," And yes, of course, the convenience is I no longer have to drive to Doncaster to talk to people about ECG's to give my Pfizer rep the opportunity to talk about something else"
HCP," But um, but the GP's don't engage, they turn off their screen"
HCP, And they're obviously sitting there watching something else
HCP,"And you're getting no questions, no engagement, no jokes work"
HCP," So there are all of these things and and the end of the day, they don't use a tool for Statin because because because the data are strong"
HCP," I think that is the case because it's not, they use it all the Statin because they had a really entertaining evening with a colleague who showed them some some interesting slides, some interesting data, but they usually remember one or two funny anecdotes rather than anything else"
HCP, So this concept that you can show a bunch of Kaplan Meier curves over the internet and thereby expect people to use Atorvastatic over Simvastatin and is has yet to from my perspective to be to show results
KAM,"Yeah, what what I find sort of quite interesting is I was having a bit of about 20 meetings since lockdown probably since June because we were sort of non promote"
KAM, We were reactive in June and we could do meetings from June onwards
KAM, And I realized for myself that I the customers and both myself get more out when we're face to face when I'm sort of eyeballing an audience because you get the facial expression
KAM, Are you getting any buying signals
KAM," Is it, is it any head shaking or even that q&a is better"
KAM," You know, so you just said exactly the same as what I would say I can far more bang for buck being stood in front of a roomful of customers being bombarded with questions, I love that, that's what I get paid to do"
KAM," And obviously, you know, I want to be passionate about the product"
KAM," You can be you can do at home to a certain extent, but then the door might open or my wife comes in, or the kids come in"
HCP,"And it also it's also meeting other people, right"
HCP," So the the participants can't interact with each other, which is, which is very difficult, they can interact with the speaker, if they're brave enough to put their hand up or to speak out and to interrupt, but they can't interact with each other, which I think is really something that you lose"
KAM,Absolutely
HCP,"And these, these, these participant interactions are often more powerful, because they'll say, oh, what do you think about what he's just said, and then the next time the guy next to him or the girl next terms that's really interesting, and that has a reinforcing effect on what I'm saying"
KAM,"Third party endorsement, I'd call that"
HCP,Absolutely
HCP," And, and it's the discussion around it between the participants that actually leads to the solidifying of the educational process"
HCP," So there are some, and these are things are lost from from from, from a Congress perspective, it's even worse, right"
HCP," So most of my good ideas, and most of my collaborations have come from running into people in a restaurant after the meeting, or during the conference presentation, God forbid, I only ever go to restaurants after meetings"
HCP, But you sit down and you talk about things
HCP," And you think well, what do you think about this"
HCP," What do you think about that reinforces the learning process, but it also then reinforces the development of new ideas"
HCP," So yeah, absolutely"
HCP, And I think this is a holding pattern
HCP, But I think human beings will respond better to being face to face in due course
HCP," I think we can kind of cope out we can kind of manage, but but to really move things along, we'll need face to face congresses again"
KAM,"Oh absolutely, they'll never go away, there'll be sort of like, I think it'd be like a bit of an 80/20"
KAM," You know, where it'll be 20% virtual, 80% you'll meetup or whatever is appropriate for that particular customer"
HCP,Yeah
HCP," And, and it could be, yes, and it depends upon the customer depends upon the setting"
HCP, It depends
HCP," So for example, from the Congress perspective, if the customer or the client or the colleague or whatever is somebody who is listening, that's very different"
HCP," But for somebody who's an active researcher, those are two different people"
HCP," So most of my clinician colleagues, they go to a conference to get drunk and hear the latest data, but they're not designing or developing future research programs"
HCP, Where as a small proportion of people that the Congress are actually there to develop future research and meet other researchers
HCP," So I think there's, there's a difference there"
HCP," And, and so, to some extent, from GPS, to where you're talking about VTE Prophylaxis, and we do need to talk about VTE Prophylaxis, I don't I don't, you must have a spiel that you need to run through"
KAM,"Well, I'm more more AF, but I am I have obviously knowledge of VTE as well"
HCP,"Okay, so what do you need to, what do you need to talk to me about"
KAM,"Well, it's more around, you know, obviously, I get the impression that you you're very sort of heart failure driven, feel like you've done a lot of work for heart failure, but totally 30, 30% ish of patients with heart failure"
KAM," But I want to ask you about the fact that we're missing not missing a lot of patients, but it has a less because of less footfall at the moment, for obvious reasons"
KAM, We're not picking up a lot of new AF patients
KAM," So how are we at Pfizer going to or as an industry going to be able to pick these patients up in a COVID world, and given the what's going on at the moment really is my question to you"
HCP,"So it's, it's a really interesting question, and there are two answers"
HCP," The first is, um I'm a GP or a jobbing clinician, how am I gonna identify a bunch of people with AF and there are lots of lots of technological ways, the vast majority, which would be completely irrelevant to the vast majority of patients with AF, they don't have an Apple Watch"
HCP," They don't have a smartphone and if they do, they don't want to use it or can't use it"
HCP," I mean, this, these technological fixes are never going to happen for the most people"
HCP, When you and I are in that in that stage of life
HCP,"We are not going to be different to these old people now, right"
HCP," So everybody thinks, oh yeah, the 20 or so, my fellows say I when I'm 80 I'll be completely ofay with smartphones, and I'll just use my Apple Watch to diagnose my atrial fibrillation and all organize to get some Apixaban sent to me, that is not gonna happen, right, because my father, who was a young stud aged 35, is now just an old fart"
HCP," And, and, and so we change, therefore, we can't expect that things are going to be different in 20 years time"
HCP," So we have to be prepared for the fact that the larger, larger proportion of AF is going to be picked up the same way as it is now"
HCP," That's and and that's going to be by opportunistic pulse checks, palpitations, or exploring people with risk factors"
HCP, Yeah
HCP," So the researcher in me, says, obviously, the contrary, the researcher in me says that there will be technological fixes, these are probably not going to be smartwatches, smartphones, or any of that stuff"
HCP," There is a there, there are numerous ways in which we can monitor people remotely, including tiny implantable devices that can do it"
HCP, And Medtronic is working on two interesting projects in people who have risk factors for AF
HCP," So we know AF doesn't occur in me, I don't have hypertension, I don't have diabetes, and I'm not fat"
HCP," But But if you if you implant a tiny device into people with risk factors, 30% of them over three years will have AF"
HCP, And that is not that is a big proportion of the people who would have been picked up opportunistically in you'll probably die earlier
KAM,"An how far is that, sorry, i was going to say how far away is that particular innovation"
HCP,"It's a study called the loop study running in Denmark and they implant- it's actually very sensibly done, they've been they've got a bunch of people with risk factors, half of whom have been employed, implanted with a loop recorder, and half of whom have not"
HCP," And then those that are implanted a new per quarter, the physicians are invited to choose whether they want to anticoagulate based on the data or not"
HCP," So obviously, the recorder picks up short bursts of AF, and there are then these people who say well, it's only a little bit of AF, let's watch a bit longer, by which time they've had a stroke"
HCP," So, so there are some really interesting concepts there"
HCP," And so the end point is not how much AF is there, the end point is strokes, which I think is really important, because previous work has always been criticized, well, it's just a little bit of AF, how much AF is AF"
HCP," And, and, and so I think so one of the- go on"
KAM,"No, no I interupted you"
HCP,"So one of the things that I think will change and and is changing is that companies will start working together, that would be my aim, or my dream would be that companies would come together with complimentary portfolios, and work together to sort some of these problems out"
HCP," So Apple can make an Apple Watch, but at the end of the day, if you don't have something that will then first of all determine how much AF is relevant and B lead to an intervention, that doesn't require any other testing, the Apple Watch is useless"
HCP, So you can't you can't use a technology to diagnose a condition but for finish the pathway there
HCP," So what you need is companies to work together to say well, where's the pathway start"
HCP, Where's the pathway end
HCP, And what is the end point
HCP, The end point is strokes
HCP, AF is completely irrelevant
HCP," You have no symptoms, by definition, otherwise, you'd have been to your GP with palpitations until you have a stroke"
HCP, So so it is totally irrelevant that you diagnose AF
HCP, What you need to do is you need to prevent strokes
HCP," And if the Apple Watch doesn't prevent strokes, it's a waste of time"
HCP," And so companies that make anticoagulation need to get wise and say how do we increase penetration, we increased penetration by getting a diagnosis and doing a pathway based study"
HCP, Here we go
HCP," There's the researcher in me, a pathway-based study of a test that leads to a patient oriented outcome, not not a diagnosis"
HCP, And that's-
KAM,"Yeah, no you make some very, very valid points, very valid points"
KAM," I mean, you know, stat, Statins, DOAC's have been around since when 20, 2011"
KAM, So they've been nine years
KAM," And I'll be here the detect protect perfect agenda, they don't teach it it's okay so I'm sure you were"
KAM," You know, we've come a long way"
KAM, But there's a hell of a long way to go
KAM," There's, the numbers are still massive, there was one when patients we detect perspective, we've got lots of patients who have had a CHAD VASC score there are nothing, I will call them ticking time bombs"
KAM," And we've got your out of range Warfarin, which slowly but surely are being moved to DOAC, whichever one, I'm not bothered if I'm honest, as long as you give them something that's suitable"
KAM," And so we're getting there, but it's so slow, but the problem is primary care about so many other things going on, even put the virus, COVID aside, it's AF isn't always, you know, front of mind, is it"
KAM, I think it's got to be pushed by the CCG by the PCN's
KAM," And otherwise, it's just we're not going to get to the bottom of it"
HCP,"Yeah, you're right"
HCP, You're right
KAM,I don't know how much interaction you have with your primary care colleagues or PCG's
KAM," Is that, in your role do you take a backseat with that"
KAM," Obviously, lots going on with"
HCP,"Say, say that again, I think you just broke up there, just transiently"
KAM,"Do you sort of have much interaction with your primary care colleagues, or pcnl CCG"
KAM, colleagues
HCP,"So I, up until a month ago, I ran the VTE program and the PE program for the trust that's now been taken over by a hematologist"
HCP," We did not have a dramatic penetration of the new guidelines, the new long term VTE PE guidelines, because they kind of came out at the wrong time of year for us"
KAM,"They came out in March, didn't they"
KAM, They came out in March
HCP,It wasn't a great time
HCP," But but yeah, no so my communication with the primary care physicians, funnily enough, is usually through meetings, meetings, organized by colleagues in the pharmaceutical industry"
HCP," And we talk about a host of things we rarely talk specifically about using Apixaban for AF, we usually talk about the concept of diagnosis, what is it"
HCP, Why is it important
HCP, And then we think about what we could do about it
HCP," And it's really interesting, because I think unless you have pharmaceutically organized educational meetings, education rarely happens in any coordinated way"
HCP, And because secondary care physicians just don't get out to see primary care physicians- we're working
HCP," I mean, it's, it's mad but most of my colleagues work, you know, 12 sessions a week"
HCP," So that's five days a week, and then one on call a week, or a weekend"
HCP," So they, when are they going to see their primary care physicians"
HCP," They only see their primary care physicians, when they say, you know what, I won't see my family Tonight, I'll go out and do a meeting about ECG's or Pfizer"
KAM,"You see, that's where I think virtual to that has its place, potentially, I know you, they're probably not going to have as much of an impact as if they were in a room together"
KAM," But it's making the consultant go out in the middle of winter, when they want to go home and have a glass of wine with their family, and then just nip into the other room for an hour and do a meeting, that for me has lots of value"
HCP,"Yes, it's true"
HCP, It's true
HCP, You're absolutely right
HCP, So that is really the best way of doing it
HCP, But who's to coordinate that
HCP, Is it
HCP, Is it the CCG
HCP, Is it some private companies second secondary private company
HCP, Or is it the pharmaceutical company direct
HCP, I need to
KAM,Everbody needs to pull together
KAM," You know, obviously, we like, you know, Pfizer, BMS, and all the dark companies, we've done lots of meetings over the last six, seven years"
KAM," I mean, God knows how many meetings, hundreds, thousands"
KAM," And which would have made a difference, eeked a difference after each one"
KAM," But it's got I think, it's got to come from CCGs and PCN', I really do, to get full buy in from them"
KAM," And yes, we help"
KAM," And but it's not the be all and end all they need to be sold on why it's important, whichever disease area that the meeting is in"
KAM," And AF, we've come a long way, in 10 years, but there's still a long way to go"
KAM," But as I said, GP's, they'll just have AF on the agenda, they have everything else"
KAM, Well
HCP,It's really hard
HCP," You know, the other thing that I think has has has changed is that there is this concept of protocols can replace education"
KAM,Don't buy that
HCP,"That worries me slightly in that in that we don't need education we've got protocols, you just follow the protocol"
HCP," And and and that has, is so pervasive now that when I do GP meetings, I barely see a GP I see mainly nurses, the GPS don't do education anymore"
HCP," So we have disengaged a whole load of middle aged GPS who never ever, ever, ever engaged with education"
HCP, And the nurses are there because they didn't get this education at medical school
KAM,Yeah
HCP,So they have a completely different approach to things
HCP, But both are now working to protocols
HCP," In which it says, This is what you should do"
HCP," It doesn't say why it doesn't give you any rich richness it just- and most people never click on the link for the primary data source, of course"
HCP," There are some so there are there are some disadvantages to the way we now try to run our healthcare service based around protocols rather than helping people make the decision by giving them the information, rather than telling them, suggesting strongly that this would be the way they could go"
HCP, But
KAM,So what do you think we should do
KAM," If you were if you were running Pfizer, and you obviously you know, our marketing department, what do you think we should be doing over the next 12/18 months"
KAM," Not just from a to grow the drug, talking about disease area perspective, what would be your sort of USP for us"
HCP,"I mean, I think that I think that most most GP's and primary care nurses recognize that there is a pathway that starts with the diagnosis of AF, but but the you can't cease the pathway at the beginning"
HCP, And and I think that companies usually assume that the diagnosis is being made effectively and efficiently
HCP, And all they have to do is stand there and wait until the patient pitches up
HCP, And then somebody will use that drug
HCP, Well I think there needs to be potentially support education
HCP, I don't know some sort of some sort of program around the the much earlier portions of the disease or the pathway
HCP, So diagnosis
HCP," And the best way of doing that is is to support some of these some of these initiatives in the community around, who's high risk"
HCP, Who needs a check when
HCP, How often do they need a check
HCP, What should that check consist of
HCP, And can we tie that check to a beneficial outcome in some logical non-made up way
KAM,"Yeah, yeah"
KAM," I mean, I, I'd like to think we're on with doing some of that"
HCP,More than some
KAM,"Yeah, we've always done lots of work when there's the CV prevent agenda that it's quite high upon primary care's agenda at the moment, which is good"
KAM, But I think they need us as an industry to chivvy the GP's along
HCP,"Yeah, I think they probably do"
HCP," I think you have, but of course, there's always there's, there's always the cynical conflict, that you're making money off prescribe of prescribers"
HCP," And I think that this cynicism is something that is very strong in, in all, all healthcare settings, it's just slightly more cynical, perhaps in the UK, because the companies are the enemy"
KAM,"It's such a shame that were perce- some, you know companies in the industry are perceived by that because, you know, I could say, you know, look how many strokes we've reduced, look how many bleeds, you know, and I mean each stroke has you know, cost between 12 and 16,000 pounds, you can multiply that God knows how many times"
KAM," And yes, we're you know we're a multi billion dollar company, yes, we're a business we still have shareholders, we, you know, we have to make money"
KAM," And so it all, just the way it is, if we're able to make money in the process, as well as saving lives, everyone's a winner"
HCP,"And and it's about the commitment, and this is why personal relationships are really important"
HCP," And this is why when people see you, and and and they get to know you they're, they start to realize that you are more than just a pusher of Apixaban, and more somebody who cares"
HCP," Yeah, absolutely"
HCP, And that is really easy to maintain over the internet
HCP, But it's difficult to build over the internet
KAM,100%
HCP,"So you, I know loads of people that I've met at conferences that I've kept in touch with through the pandemic, even though we haven't been seeing each other face to face"
HCP, That's because I have a foundation on which to build
KAM,"Yeah, yeah, you're completely right, which is why face to face is pivotal moving forward even beyond that"
HCP,"Yeah, maybe maybe lower volume face to face or face to face with a couple of touch bases subsequently"
KAM,Yeah
HCP,"But I think if they know that the team is not there just to sell but it's also to achieve outcomes for patients, that's really helpful"
KAM,"Yeah, you make a lot of sense"
KAM, You see we're both on the same wavelength there
KAM, I just wish you were one of my customers
HCP,It's because we're old
KAM,It's funny
KAM, My cousin is a GP in Leeds
HCP,"Oh, really"
KAM,"Yeah, you might, you might even know Steve, do you know Steven Feldman"
HCP,"Well, I know of him"
HCP," I mean, I don't you know"
HCP, There are 85 GP practices in Leeds
HCP, So I know a fair bit of them
KAM,"But I think, his practice is around more Morley area I think, but he's, he's got fingers in lots of pies, he runs lots of different businesses"
KAM," But anyway, and but yes, I know quite a lot people over there in Yorkshire"
KAM, Yeah
KAM, We've gone over our time
KAM," But I know we didn't get to have, we had lots of good discussion around COVID and what what you say makes absolute sense"
KAM, I'll definitely take lots of it on board and use it from a local perspective in Manchester
KAM," I mean, I picked vendors very well over here like it does in most areas of the UK, to be honest, but we can never afford to rest on our laurels because you've got"
KAM, You've got four good drugs out there
KAM," Let's be honest, they all offer value"
KAM," And it's up to us to sort of give clinicians the reasons why in more patients than not, Apixaban is the right choice"
HCP,"Yeah, absolutely right"
HCP, Absolutely right
KAM,Yeah well nice nice to meet you
HCP,Take care of yourself
KAM,And enjoy your calls this afternoon and stay safe
HCP,Bye bye
KAM,"Alright, see you Klaus"
KAM, Nice to meet you
KAM, Bye bye
