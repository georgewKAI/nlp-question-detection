KAM,Good morning
HCP,Hello
KAM,Hi
KAM," And well I guess just before I start to and I introduce myself, I would just like to take this opportunity firstly to thank you, and and your colleagues for the outstanding work that you've done throughout the pandemic"
KAM," It's been a very challenging year this year, and I'm sure it has been for yourself in the job that you do"
KAM," And so I'll just introduce myself, so you know who I am"
KAM," So I'm Sarah and, and I've worked for Pfizer for 20 years now in various different roles, but most recently, in secondary care, covering anticoagulation, as a VTE specialist"
KAM," And we can probably tell from my accent that I work up in the northeast of England, so Newcastle area, and I guess I was asked to be part of this research, to help to understand how to better engage clinicians like yourselves over a virtual platform"
KAM, And so I guess the majority of what we do now is delivered virtually hence the importance of trying to get it right and make the experience work for both me both ourselves and yourself
KAM, And so it would be really good to understand a little bit more about you about your role and how your time split between research and clinical duties and how you've managed this year and how you've been impacted by a Covid
KAM, So be really good just to get a little bit of insight about yourself
HCP,"Oh, well, that's very nice of you"
HCP," I'm Klaus, I'm a cardiologist"
HCP, I work in Leeds
HCP," I have a half time research and half time, clinical responsibility, I run the heart failure unit in Leeds and I also do pacemaker implantation defibrillaters and stuff"
HCP," And I also, until last month ran the VTE Governance Program for the trust that has been taken over now not unreasonably by a hematologist who has recently been appointed specifically to this role"
HCP," But up until then, there wasn't a hematologist who was taking on this chair role"
HCP," Which meant I managed a very small team of specialists, pharmacists and nurses to do VTE assessments and also do the root cause analysis assessments for people who have hospital acquired VTE's and to and to write the operating protocols for anticoagulation or prophylactic anticoagulation for people coming into hospital"
HCP, And my research interests are around heart failure and device therapy
HCP," So pacemakers, basically how to program them how to use them properly, and how to get the best out of them"
HCP," And so the last that I've been fairly protected, because my primary employer is the university so and I don't do any clinical on call anymore the last few years"
HCP, So I didn't do much in the way of COVID direct facing COVID work but myself and the other x clinical academics ran the outpatient service while our full time clinicians were running the COVID wards
HCP," And so that kind of changed our timetables a little bit, we managed to spend a fair we've I mean, the one thing that has changed is we barely go in"
HCP," So on a Tuesday, on a Wednesday or Thursday, I spend all day in the hospital"
HCP, But I don't do any Ward work
HCP," So Monday, Tuesday, Friday, my research has been run entirely without face to face, which is kind of difficult"
KAM,"Hows that felt because that's a big change, isn't it"
HCP,"Yeah, it's a pain because it because if you're doing mouse work, mice don't get COVID as far as we know"
HCP," So, university shut down everything"
HCP," So my basic science, collaborators struggled for a little while"
HCP, And not because the mice were getting infected
HCP," But because the university felt that there was risks to them going in and working on their, on their animal models and on their basic science, and even the people doing data analytics were barred from going home, from going into work sorry"
HCP," that's now settled largely, and we have a large number of people coming and going for part of the week"
HCP, And but my group is clinical
HCP," So our patients, our patients are our subjects"
HCP, And we're at risk of COVID
HCP," And therefore we have to shut down all clinical research from March until very recently, some very recently, in September started doing clinical clinical research again, which is a real pain"
HCP," And yeah, but but but there we are, so things are starting to settle down a little bit"
KAM,Well thats positive and a good step forward
KAM, Yeah
KAM," I'm actually quite intrigued when I was having a look at role profile, and I wasn't sure how applicable it was going to be to talk to you about VTE, I wasn't sure how often you would come across and pass patients with DVT or PE"
KAM," But I'm quite, I'm quite pleasantly surprised that you have such a role that you've had"
KAM, When did you hand over the reins
HCP,"And, well, about a month ago, I've been doing it for about eight years"
HCP, Okay
HCP," And because it was seen as a non hematology problem, because this is this is not the treatment of DVT and PE's, but the prevention, although I was involved in in the medical and most of the patients, of course, not hematology patients, there medical patients, surgical patients"
HCP," So the role kind of got invited or assigned to a cardiologist as it had been for many years, partly because we do an awful lot of anticoagulation anyway"
HCP," And yeah, but not unreasonably, in the summer, when the hematologist was appointed"
HCP, She had some space in her in her timetable
HCP,So she's now taking that on
HCP, And so I did it until about a month ago
KAM,"Oh, that's brilliant"
KAM, It's brilliant
KAM," So I presume that will be good to understand what um, what your what your VTE protocol looks like"
KAM," Have you had an opportunity to review the recently published by BT guidance, whichever became, it's probably a really bad time in March of this year"
KAM, It would be interesting to understand what your protocol currently look like in terms of managing both inacute and long term treatment patient
HCP,"Yes, so um in in general, the prophylactic and the prophylactics involves obviously low molecular weight heparin, we have shied away from mechanical treatments or mechanical prevention treatments, because the data are really not robust enough, although the surgeons are still quite keen on stockings and inflatable legs and stuff"
HCP," But we really have focused down, we had some issues with delivery to the balance between Tinxaparin and Enoxaparin as you know, towards the end of last year, 2019 became very difficult"
HCP, So we had to change our protocols there
HCP," And in terms of treatment, well, we follow the standard NICE guidelines, there's nothing radical there at all"
HCP, Most people are offered a NOAC
HCP," And in with a loading dose, and then and then a maintenance dose, I think"
KAM,Yeah
KAM, Fantastic
KAM," Obviously, again, in terms of the NICE guidance, it was it was eagerly anticipated, because the previous update was in 2012, which was prior to any of the DOAC's receiving market authorization"
KAM," So it was been, it was quite easy anticipated"
KAM, And I guess there's probably the biggest change is around the long term treatment recommendation
KAM," But I guess in terms of completeness, obviously, the acute phase of treatment was around the recommendations of either apixaban or rivaroxaban in that acute phase of treatment"
KAM," And then, in the longer term treatment says, and I think one of the changes was in terms of if, if the current treatments not well tolerated, or the clinical situation or person's preferences have changed, consider switching to apixababn, if the current treatment is is a doac other than apixaban"
KAM," So obviously, that was quite a big change in terms of that prophylaxis piece"
KAM," And I don't know what what difference that would make at all, and if they're new to your treatment, any longer term prophylactic protocals"
HCP,"So we had had a fairly relaxed approach to it, we have always favored either using rivaroxaban, or apixaban in our population, based on patient preferences around volume of tablets per day"
HCP, I think apixaban was was the flay was the primary and primary approach
HCP," Most people use apixaban, some people were fans of rivaroxaban, but partly simply because of the once a day thing"
HCP, And for older people or people with large volumes of tablets on multiple medications
HCP, So but but it was we never really used much in the way of the other agents for this particular indication
HCP, So it was never really we never really had to change that much when it came through that
HCP," Yeah, as you say that apixaban is should be highly favored"
HCP, It didn't make much difference to our protocols
KAM,"Yeah, that's good"
KAM," That's good to hear cuz obviously, the evidence base and the safety profile was something which was highlighted in the NICE review, around apixban and especially in terms of that belief profile in the longer term treatment phase"
HCP,Sorry the what profile
HCP, The lead profile
KAM,yeah that was re flagged as being significantly better with apixaban in that longer term treatment phase
KAM, And that was that was taken from antifiac study And it was really had really clear benefits for patients in terms of the fact that they weren't at an increased risk of having a bleed compared to placebo in that longer term phase
KAM," And, obviously, we know that patients patient, there's a large proportion of patients who are at risk of recurrent VTE with the ESC guidance, which was published in 2019"
KAM, And we've got that new intermediate category of patients
KAM, So potentially more patients that are out there who could benefit from longer term treatment
KAM, So I think the NICE publications probably made it a little bit easier
KAM, A to identify those patients who they are
KAM," And B to gives clinicians like yourself the confidence that actually, if you do need to use treatment in the longer term, NICE is really clear about what that recommendation is, and so i guess"
HCP,recommendations
HCP, And that and that recommendation is bigger than that recommendation is apixaban long term
KAM,"Yeah, yeah"
KAM," And that was based upon the efficacy and the safety data from antifiacs study, and so clear, a clear benefit in terms of patients in terms of that risk benefit profile, and your longer term treatment phase"
KAM," So I don't know, I know, you've said that you've passed on the reins to hematology now"
KAM," And I presume that They'll look at, protocals in the longer term"
KAM," And I don't know where where was your protocol up to what what did it recommend after six months the patient, but it's still either or apixaban rivaroxaban"
HCP,"Yeah, it didn't"
HCP,"We didn't, we didn't come down on advising changing"
HCP," um I have to say, I don't I'm not a I'm not a huge fan of because of course, remember by then they're not really our patients anymore, right"
HCP, They're under the primary care
HCP, So our protocols were around the acute management
HCP," So in the mouth, shortly after discharge, and then they usually get a letter to the GP saying this is what's happened"
HCP, You could consider changing to apixaban in six months time if there's still an elevated risk
HCP, But we didn't mandate that that really wasn't we didn't see that as being particularly our role in telling GP's what to do once the patients are under their care
HCP," And yeah, then maybe I have that maybe I have that wrong"
HCP," So the advice from NICE, presumably says that if they remain at elevated risk, you should convert them to apixaban long term is that  what NICE said"
KAM,"Yeah, so the exact NCE words I'm sorry we're not allowed to share any of our slides with you today"
HCP,No no thats absolutely fine
KAM,"So the the actual wording is for patients who do not have renal impairment, active cancer, or established triple positive understand the phospholipid syndrome, or extremes of bodyweight, either continue to need treatment with the current anticoagulant, if it is, well tolerated"
KAM," Or If the treatment is not well tolerated, or the clinical situation or person's preferences have changed, consider switching to apixaban than if the current treatment is a DOAC other than apixaban"
KAM," So if the patient's not well tolerated, they're not tolerating the DOAC that they are currently managed on"
KAM," At that point, for a longer term treatment, we would consider switching to apixaban or to doac other than apixaban"
HCP,"Yes, it's a long it's a long description"
HCP," So that's why we, we stopped we made it very much simpler and said, Look, you know, if they're tolerating what they're on, and it's a it's a patient choice really"
HCP," Because we didn't I have, I always worry slightly about the real world risks of changing people if you if you don't get continuity, or then there's a decision made well, you know, what changing is all like let's, let's just stop it or something"
HCP," You know, any change to patient regiments has to be very carefully considered, particularly when you're in a busy primary care setting"
HCP," So we didn't, we didn't mandate that"
HCP, But we did reflect the guidelines in our guide the guidelines in our operating protocols
KAM,"Yeah ofcourse, I guess it's just been aware that thats been updated because some clinicians haven't had a chance to review that for obvious reasons with the situation that we found ourselves in in the last 6-8 months so"
HCP,"And yes, I agree"
HCP," It hasn't really filtered through dramatically, as well as it could have done because of course, the patients were were largely not returning for follow up appointments"
HCP," So what would happen given the pandemic situation is that one would make a follow up telephone call and, and make a decision on whether they needed long term treatment"
HCP," And then and then write to the GP and say, you can either change or you can leave it because you'd know whether the patient is tolerating it"
HCP, And and I have to say that I suspect most people would have left is the last thing GP's want to be doing in the midst of a pandemic is bringing in a load of people who are stable on rivaroxaban and organizing a change to apixaban for what they might see as marginal benefits
HCP," And somebody who's done quite well, I appreciate the benefit"
HCP, I appreciate the leading risk is lower with apixaban perhaps no question about that
HCP," But but on balance, I think most people will have taken a view and said the risks of organizing a switch are somewhat lower, with a face to face appointment may be somewhat lower than just leaving them on rivaroxaban at the moment"
HCP," So it's a difficult time that you have to get this NICE recommendation widely, widely implemented"
KAM,I think it's been lost in translation
HCP,"No, I agree"
HCP, I think you're right Sarah
HCP," I don't think there's any I don't, I don't think many people are doing it"
HCP, It wouldn't surprise me if the if the conversion rate is very low
KAM,"Yeah, yeah, I guess what, what would what we would hope in terms of when you were reviewing patients, and that acute initial phase of treatment"
KAM," And when we consider all of the data, for apixaban especially in terms of the safety profile, profile, both in major bleeds and clinically relevant knowledgeably, that's the only doac that shows a significant reduction across both of those parameters"
KAM," It does stand out for safety profile, and it will be good to see that patients were started on the picture barn, and then that makes that journey for them a little bit"
KAM, A little bit easier
KAM, In terms of evidence in the safety profile
KAM," And I guess, hopefully, hopefully clinicians like yourself will get a chance to sit down and review it once, once we're out of the current situation"
HCP,"Yeah I mean, I think I think I think your job is very difficult at the moment, people are so focused on things"
HCP, Yeah
HCP," So So and, and, and trying to bring out an a change"
HCP, And that is probably a long term
HCP," So this is the challenge, right"
HCP," You only ever know the bleeds that you didn't, that you caused"
HCP, You don't know about the bleeds that you prevented or avoided
HCP," And, and, and, but you certainly know about the hassle that you had in getting the patient from one agent to another"
HCP," So that there's all sorts of conflicts, the data really haven't been widely advertised, in terms of the way we manage it"
HCP," And the way the protocols are implemented, given the current situation, we just rewrote everything in March"
HCP," Saying, Don't come to the hospital, we'll do it over the phone"
HCP," And I think so I think over the next 12 months, your job and none of your colleagues will have to be to make sure these NICE guidelines are fully implemented the big job"
KAM,a big job yes
KAM," Hopefully, we'll get a chance to come back in and do some face to face appointments"
KAM," And no, it is interesting what you say because we do have numbers needed to treat in numbers needed to hold for apixaban and we would need 200 patients would need to be treated for apixaban to cause one episode of major or clinically relevant non major bleeds"
KAM, So it's interesting that you say it's only those patients that you've actually see who do have to deal with the ones that are in the forefront of your mind
KAM, Those who don't
HCP,"yeah, absolutely"
HCP," That's always, always the way though"
KAM,"Yeah, but the numbers needed to treat are quite compelling for apixaban as well, like you don't need to treat 14 patients to prevent one episode of recurrent BTE related deaths, so really quite, quite compelling"
KAM, And I think that's been reflected in the NICE guidance as well so
HCP,Yes
HCP," Yes, no question"
HCP, But it but it has fallen down the priority list unfortunately
HCP, Yeah
HCP," So, so this will need readdressing"
HCP, I think the data are compelling
HCP," And but when you're fighting fires, it's really hard for the primary care of physicians, most of whom are the ones looking after these people"
HCP," Now, I i think i think your point is very well made"
HCP," And I think that certainly the patients that remain under secondary care follow up and would would, would be converted"
HCP, But those people who have gone to primary care follow up
HCP," So these are people presumably who have an ongoing indication for DVT and V, VTE prophylactic"
HCP," These are people who presumably had an unexplained event, and not those with cancer or so"
HCP, So that so there's an issue there
HCP, Yeah okay
HCP," So those are those are that's the problem, though, those are rarely under"
HCP, those are rarely under secondary care long term
HCP," You see, that's the problem you have unexplained"
KAM,"So if the patient is the patient that would fall into that unprovoked category, which has been further stratified in ASC guidance, where there's where there's now that low, intermediate and high risk categorization for patients that those patients that would fall in the intermediate and last"
KAM," Yeah, yeah"
KAM, We know that there's a high proportion of patients do have the current through the T's and C's
KAM," So looking at that risk, stratification, and so there is a lot there is a lot to be done"
KAM," Potentially, this year is not the right time to do it"
KAM," And next year, maybe um chapter two, I'm not sure if your next is the next call is it 10:30"
HCP,"Yes, in three minutes, but don't worry"
KAM,I didnt know if you needed to have a break or not
KAM, So you've got a few of these to do then
KAM, Are you doing any clinical stuff today or any research
HCP,I have
HCP," I have a desktop here that has emails coming in at a rate of knots, so I felt the need to continue to do some work between meetings"
KAM,Very impressive multitasking
HCP,And have you got other meetings today
KAM,"We have Yes, yes"
KAM, We've got a big company meeting which is actually it was meant to start at 10 o'clock and they've just pushed it back to to 1130 so that I won't miss it
KAM, So it's been really lovely talking to you
KAM, Im going to let you sign off so you can have a quick look at your emails before your next call
KAM," Okay, thanks for being so engaged"
KAM, Good luck
KAM,Bye bye
