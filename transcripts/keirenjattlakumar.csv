KAM,"Nice to meet you, Dr"
KAM," Ribchester, I hear you're very, very seasoned"
HCP,I've been called many things
KAM,That's probably one of the better things then
HCP,Please call me John by the way
KAM,"Okay, John, I will do well"
KAM," So you know, we've got 15 minutes"
KAM," And really, it's just a little bit of an experiment, of course, to see how we engage"
KAM," But I think it was a really fabulous opportunity for me to just look at your account, you're obviously in a very large practice, which is a pcn of its own right"
KAM," And your clinical director, so please tell me a little bit about how you manage anticoagulation"
KAM, We know that the East Kent prescribing group guidance does recommend Apixaban
KAM," Particuarly proberly clearence  are bleeding, and I think that's been updatedin May isnt it"
HCP,I think so
HCP," Yes, that's right, although everything's running a bit behind time because of COVID, of course"
HCP, So
KAM,"In terms of the latest of NICE guidance, which you're aware of,when switching patients are wafarin"
KAM, So how practices in your in your how is your PCN managing it
KAM, And can you tell me a little bit about how they're doing
KAM," Sure, yes,"
HCP,"I mean, I think in common with lots of other PCNs and practices"
HCP," COVID has given us challenges, but also opportunities"
HCP," And we have have had to redeploy staff from many of our traditional clinics into COVID work, whether it's on the Hot site, or we're just cranking up to do an immunization site now as well"
HCP, So it's given us obviously a tragedy having COVID around but it's given us the opportunity to persuade more people to switch from warfarin to something that doesn't require having to come in and having INR's done
HCP," My first exposure to Apixaban is through our UTC, our urgent treatment center"
HCP," Because as I was telling some of your colleagues, we we run a community DVT diagnosis and treatment service from they're the only one in East Kent and we cover about 200,000 head of population with that not just our own pcn large, if not probably more than that, because we are more accessible than the hospital one"
HCP," You know, we're open seven days a week, 12 hours a day"
HCP," And ultrasound is available six days a week, both of which beat hospital he said sounding smug"
HCP, But
KAM,I have to say it sounds really smart
KAM," But you know, quite impressive"
HCP,"Well, I mean, it avoids situation, which sometimes happens where people are on low molecular weight heparin for in hospital situation for 10 or more days, until they finally get the ultrasound or be told they need to be on it at all because they haven't got a DVT"
HCP," So the longest you're waiting in waiting armed services two days, but more often than not, you get done the same day"
HCP, And so you're not on heparin unnecessarily and you're straight on to apixaban
HCP, So
HCP, So it's a long answer to your short question
HCP, But my first exposure to apixaban is through our DVT service
HCP," So we started off with rivaroxaban, simply because it was the first probably a dirty word, but and then we switched to apixiban, principally because we were with one of the hospital hematologists"
HCP, And she switched the hospital service to a pixie ban
HCP, So we switched as well
KAM,And she switched it
KAM," Is there anything particularly I mean, from your practitioner perspective"
KAM, Is there anything that you particularly like about apixarban
HCP,"I think, I think to be honest, it was a joint venture, you know, it I mean, it has been a reliable drug, we haven't had any complications that I'm aware of"
HCP," And it's also good that if we patients are transferred from community services to hospital or back, again, there's come to this continuity, you know, you do get a situation in primary care where you start on one drug and the hospital switch to a different one in the same category"
HCP," And then the same thing happens the opposite direction, which is very confusing for patients, and potentially dangerous with anticoagulation, because they can end up taking two instead of one because they sometimes get, get the wrong message and carry on with what they had before and take something new, you may have witnessed yourself so"
HCP, So it's partly convenience as part of the safety
HCP," And with regard to our, our, our warfarinised patients, the very fact assays but you don't have to come into the practice anymore"
HCP," Fine Art, if you switch to this tablet, and certainly new tablet, new patients with AF, we will put straight on draw apixaban"
HCP, It's slightly more difficult to get people off warfarin
HCP,"Because they become slightly surgical psychologically dependent upon the regular contact and the regular tests and it's probably our fault because we've drummed into them, you know, you this does need monitoring, and then you try and switch on to another drug that doesn't need monitoring now and they say oh yeah, I'd rather stick in one"
KAM,"I mean, that was going to be my next because I have had a couple of practice managers or GPS that i've spoken to saying to me, you know, there's a cohort of patients that we don't, don't want to switch over, because they're isolated, they're elderly, they need the contact, they want to come in and do you have sort of those sort of cohort of patients as well, or"
HCP,we do
HCP," I mean, we've got 25%, over 65 years"
HCP, So we have a typical sort of coastal town
HCP," Population, this, this happens"
HCP," And a lot of people actually, almost it's the highlight of the week, you know, get into the building, speak to a nurse that they know, perhaps use, whoever has transported this person they know it's social contract"
HCP," But it's not only that, but it's also partly the fact that a lot of people having been told, you know, this is a dangerous drug, wafarin that is, it's got to be monitored, or you could bleed or having a stroke, to suddenly say, Well, that's all unnecessary"
HCP," Now you can have a tablet with no monitoring, that's a bit of a change that some people have trouble with"
KAM,"And we know that sort of weird in terms of nice knife, they've got a sort of a estimation figure of people who are more often than not in their TTR"
KAM, And that's about 47
KAM,1%
KAM, And I just got some figures here for your practice
KAM," And that's 140 of your patients that are, you know, timing through a therapeutic race"
KAM, They're not in they're not appropriately anticoagulated
KAM," And so that temporary, of those have a risk of stroke, high risk of stroke"
KAM," So you know, there are figures that from a health point of view, even though you might have people that don't want to switch over there is a health risk for them this stroke bleeds depending which we show, you know, well,"
HCP,I haven't done an audit recently
HCP, So he told me something I didn't think
KAM,"you've actually got so this is some DPP data, you're aware of the detect, protect, protect agenda"
KAM,Unknown Speaker  6:49Yeah
KAM, Yeah
KAM,So the detection is what are you doing around undiagnosed patients
KAM, How do you detect at the moment
KAM, What do you do
HCP,AF you mean
KAM,"yeah, detecting it,"
HCP,several measures
HCP," I mean, opportunistically, if people come to our urgent treatment center, we've got these devices, you put two fingers on, and, and you you can see as if it's happening in and it's not intermittent, of course, yeah"
HCP," All of our clinics, it's drummed into everybody that, you know, we're looking for AF the whole time when we're twice we've done this opportunistic thing during the winter flu campaign, that the person giving the immunization literally just takes a pulse"
HCP, It's
KAM,30 seconds
KAM, Yeah
HCP,"Yeah, dead simple thing to do"
HCP, I think we stole the idea from somebody else who did it about five years ago
HCP," And every year we pick up, you know, 20, people with AF"
HCP," And rather, rather amazingly, we've had other arrhythmias as well, including complete heart block, which was straight into hospital for a pacemaker run along with"
KAM,just a really something simple that the team can do that
KAM," You know, whoever, you know, support staff, but also in terms you've got on your you've got 103 undetected, estimated undetected patients"
KAM," But in terms of the protect cohort, these are people that are had to have a chance to or or at risk on a register somewhere, but not anticoagulated"
KAM, And you there's an estimated of 177 patients there who are can be found in a register somewhere
KAM, But I'm not giving any sort of DOAC or Wafarin
HCP,Really
KAM,yeah
KAM," And of course, if you wanted anyone of my team to go through this a little bit more detail after this call, we are very happy to do that with you and show you present you that data that I've got in front of me, but is a very interesting thing"
KAM," And actually, that's about 15"
KAM,4%
KAM," And in the region, it's about 16"
KAM," So you are actually under the region, but national average is about 14"
KAM, So the best performing region in England 6
KAM,"9%, which is amazing"
KAM," So that's basically looking down your register, looking at the higher risk scores, the diabetes that have changed the chance of bath, basically, and identifying that they may well be at high risk"
HCP,So I've written those figures down
HCP, I'm concerned to know that
HCP," Yeah, we do do regular audits, we employ two pharmacists directly and one pharmacy technician"
HCP," And we they do they often do audits like this, but I mean, come tomorrow"
HCP," I will see what we can do about this, because I'm not happy about that"
HCP, And we need to do something about identifiable
HCP, Yeah
HCP," Okay, well, I'm concerned about that"
HCP, And thank you for telling me
HCP," And,"
KAM,"John, if you want some more support to do that any more information, we're very willing to set up a separate meeting and do that with your colleague"
KAM," Works in East Kent, and I can pass it over as well"
HCP,"Well, thank you for that"
HCP," I mean, as I say, I hope we've got the right staff in the right grade and the right number to do this ourselves, I mean you know, we do mock we do regular week regular, we do one audit a month actually"
HCP, And very often it's drug and monitoring related because those are easy things to audit
HCP," And if we do find a problem, we address it straight away"
HCP," But But those figures, even if they are roughly average, they don't please me"
HCP, So I need to do something about that
KAM,What's your patient pathway Look at in your practice
KAM, What are the sort of main touch points that you get somebody coming in
HCP,coming in with
KAM,a say say AF somebodies just presenting with AF what is the pathway that they would take
HCP,"Well, if someone comes in with a if they they will be started off on appropriate drugs and investigative or underlying conditions by by their own GP, we have one GP who's a gypsy cardiologist"
HCP, And he can be referred to if necessary
HCP, And then then they're straight into the clinic
HCP, We have several nurses who are our INR nurses
HCP," And we have designated GPS, one, one on each of our three sides, who are the designated anticoagulation doctors"
KAM,"Brilliant, I'm going to go a little bit of peace, I'm going to just get off this subject, because actually, while I've got you here, I just want to get some insight off you"
KAM, And that is really what is how can I word this
KAM," Let's say, what is the easiest way for a rep like myself to get get in touch with the GP or practice manager"
HCP,That's a question that goes down through the years doesn't it that one
HCP," Yeah, I mean, what what we tend to do now now that we have got this little pharmacy unit of two pharmacists, and pharmacy technicians is if there is an approach former representative, go to them first, they will probably assess, you know, the value of the message, to be honest, you know, and if there is a value for patients in the message, they will then bring it to the attention to our prescribing lead, or one of our GPS, who happens to be the practice chairman as well, is prescribing lead"
HCP," And he also analyzes all, and presents presents back to us all the NICE guidelines that are relevant to general practice once a month as well"
HCP, So he's he's got a pretty key role in all of that
HCP," And I think probably the wrong way to do it is just try to just approach one of the 25 GPS, because that's not really their role to change, prescribing policy"
HCP, It will be our lead prescribing GP in conjunction with the two pharmacists
KAM,And every every practice has a lead prescriber then do they
HCP,"no, its up to everybody to do exactly what they want"
HCP," As I say we are a single practice looking after 41,000 patients"
HCP," I'm a large practice enthusiast, but I would be wouldn't I"
HCP," But one of the great things about any large practice is, you can grow people to have specific roles, which benefit patient care, and upskill everybody, and we've got leads in just about everything like I mean, I'm I'm musculoskeletal"
HCP," I'm also GP director of strategy, but you know, we've got to lead for probably every discipline, you can think of the major ones"
KAM,"Yeah, because you're quite a big practice"
KAM," So I sometimes often think with the GPS tell practice managers don't take the calls, you know, because they're quite hard to understand their job, because really, you know, you've got all these reps calling them"
KAM, And they're incredibly busy
KAM, And this is a very difficult time anyway
KAM, So this is
HCP,"the I mean, yeah, I recognize that story"
HCP," I mean, before COVID, we, we have one coffee morning, a week on each of the three sites where we would see reps face to face, and Okay, they used to book up quite a long time in advance"
HCP," But we it was, it was impossible otherwise, because, you know, with a large practice, you know, 25 GPS 41,000 patients, it was quite an obvious place to try to get into and we got to a point at one stage about four or four mornings a week we had people coming in and it just got a bit a bit crazy and unmanageable, and resentments built up and nobody had a good, a good experience, certainly not the rep, certainly not the GP"
HCP," So you know, what one session Fridays typically on during coffee on each of the three sides, and that worked quite well"
HCP," We also have every well before COVID that we had clinical meetings three, Monday, lunch times out of four, the fourth one being a business one"
HCP, And very often we had we have clinical meetings which either be internal or we'd have an external speaker and some pharma companies would would sponsor someone to come in Yes
HCP, And then and sometimes often two actually reps will be in there in the meeting as well
HCP, We do like to be non promotional that inevitably they would be about a subject where the pharma has an interest in the drug
HCP," So, again, we've we've had AF and stroke"
HCP, And I think that was actually Pfizer's who sponsored that one
KAM,"Although I'm actually stroke as a key driver in the NHS long term plan and is based on data, you know, we can only present the fact in terms of compliance, you know, you know, I'm very conscious of the time, and I don't want to take any much more of your time, I really have enjoyed speaking to you"
KAM," And if you really do want any more data to go through in your East Kent area, your particular practice, were very happy to do that"
KAM, Thank you so much for your time
HCP,"Well, thank you very much, and thank you for those figures, which which do worry me, but you know, it's good to it's good to get that from you"
HCP, And I'll certainly do something about it
HCP, So
KAM,take care
KAM, Bye
