KAM,"Hi, Samantha, are you alright"
HCP,Hello
HCP," Yes, thank you"
KAM,Thank you for joining joining me today
KAM," Now I'm going to apologize in advance I woke up this morning with the most watching cold you can imagine medication at the moment and I've got, you know, pounding head and the blocked ears and sinuses and all that it's all going on today"
KAM, I didn't want to cancel because I know it takes a lot of effort to organize and plan these thing
KAM," So I plan to proceed as normal but if I stop and start sneezing or sniffling, I apologize"
HCP,It's okay no problem
KAM,"Well, I'm used to lots of background noise"
KAM, I've got kids
KAM," So, you know, don't worry about that in the slightest"
HCP,I'm sorry
HCP," It's just I always pre warn now because one of my dogs does snore very, very loudly"
HCP," It's always a I've had people go, what's that noise"
HCP," And I'm like, it's the dog"
KAM,"You know what, I read an article yesterday about it was about a dog that had found his own electric blanket and had taken a shine to it was a greyhound, I think we see quite thin type of dog racing dog"
KAM," It'd found that those electric blanket in the double beds that the owners had in the flat and they came in one morning, and they found it literally lying in the bed, pawr sticking out asleep, snoring, and they pitch in pitcher"
KAM, That was the most hilarious thing ever and I just thought that was funny
HCP,That is exactly what ours do
HCP," They swear they think they're humans, not dogs and that's probably my fault but they're my fairy babies"
KAM,"Oh, how many of you got by the way"
HCP,I've got three
HCP, I've got two Yorkshire Terriers and a pug
HCP, So they're small
HCP, And
KAM,Yeah
KAM," So and no, my fifteen year old daughter's been trying really hard for me to greet her to have a puppy because her dad, she goes every other weekend"
KAM, He's got
KAM," He's got three dogs, they've just got a third one and she's desperate to get a puppy and like I can't manage your puppy on top of everything else"
KAM, You know what kids are like Mum I'll do everything
KAM, Don't worry
KAM, I'm like err no you won't I'll be the one cleanig it out and doing walks so not happening at the moment
HCP,Yeah
HCP," It's, it is hard work"
HCP, We went from two to three thinking it'l be fine and it isn't
KAM,I made that mistake with my children I went from two to three thinking it was no big deal and had another one but it's a lot harder
KAM, Oh it's so funny
KAM," Anyway, let me focus on what we're doing today"
HCP,No worries
KAM,Right
KAM," Okay, so it's a, we've got probably about 10 minutes, not very long at the moment but the plan was to talk to you a bit about your role and for me to understand your bit better"
KAM, Erm I'll probably just give you a brief overview of my role if that's okay with you and then we can kind of just see where the conversation leads
KAM," So I'm Noren, I'm a network sales specialist in East London, northeast London at the moment"
KAM," Currently in tier two, waiting to hear if we're moving to tier three, I look after Eliquis or Apixaban, which is a no act for reducing stroke"
KAM, It no doubt I have patients
KAM, So that's the product that I look after
KAM," There were two as of last month, but literally only one product at the moment and I suppose from my point of view, erm so PCN clinical pharmacists are like an emerging a new, a new breed of super-pharmacies shall we say, and it's a really exciting, exciting time at the moment, because you're involved in lots of lots of different things"
KAM, And I think what I'd like to do is get a better understanding of your role and kind of what your priorities are
KAM," And also to find out a bit about what made you decide to do you know, the core 18 months and to go into that a bit further"
KAM,"So if you could do that, that would be brilliant"
HCP,"Yeah, absolutely erm I mean, right"
HCP," Okay, this is so yeah to start out from the beginning, I'm not actually a PCN clinical pharmacist"
HCP, I am a clinical pharmacist
HCP, Yeah
HCP," But I am private, I have been imposed before the pcn's and, erm have been doing this job before the even initial NHS England pilot sort of five years ago"
HCP," In fact, I was part of the focus group that brought that together"
HCP, Erm so I don't know if it helps to sort of go over a little bit of my my background
HCP, Erm so I went to university in Bradford and it was a sandwich course so I did did that went into hospital because that's where I felt my natural fit was
HCP, There's a small DPH so I was being taught alongside the junior doctors on the wards
HCP," Erm and we you know, you reach me point where your like, this isn't going to go any further, getting a bit bored"
HCP," Erm and I moved into primary care, and I didn't really know much about primary care and you and you know, that was"
HCP," God that was 12 years ago and I don't think a huge amount has changed even then if the people see hospital pharmacists, they see community pharmacist, you say primary care pharmacists and they see CCG, they don't see, oh, well, PCT as it was then they don't see anything else"
HCP, Erm so I was one of the pharmacy police
HCP," Erm as we were affectionately monikered, erm so we would be set sort of more or less a work plan by the PCT, or the CCG, in terms of cost savings, safety audit, things like that were very much worked in the background and that's still ongoing, that is still happening in every single practice, there will be a CCG work plan that the erm that the practice is is looking at"
HCP," Okay, okay"
HCP," Erm then I got a little bit bored of having, you know, I had 10 practices that I was visiting in a week, I was only getting a couple of hour in each, didn't really have a huge amount of patient contact"
HCP, Erm I'd done my prescribing course I was keen to do that
HCP," But things are difficult and how a lot of us from that sort of cohort, at that time got into our jobs was we talked somebody into employing us and that's exactly what I did"
HCP, And I had to
KAM,Quite the saleswoman yeah
HCP,"Yeah well, you know, I had a practice"
HCP, That was APS
HCP," So it was it was owned by the PCT but with the white paper, way back when and date, honestly"
HCP," Yeah, it's erm it had to be sold, and a big private company bought it"
HCP," Okay, as part of their, you know, they're a big company that owns care homes and other things like that and they bought the practice and they were really running on locum GPS, the patient experience wasn't very good"
HCP," The prescribing was going off the wall, it's was very hard to engage people and I sat down with the practice manager and went, do you know, I could do this, this and this"
HCP," I could look after your prescribing, I could put some guidelines and protocols in place to try and keep things get things more under control"
HCP, You're in trouble with the PCT because you're overspending on your prescribing and I can bring that down
HCP, Yeah
HCP," Erm and she took it to her bosses, they sat down with me and you know, we had a bit of too and forth, and they ended up employing me and it was brilliant"
HCP," I was seeing patients in clinic I was, you know, I had a hand I had control of what was happening with the prescribing"
HCP," I was a resource to the GPS, they knew they could just message me or ring me and go 'what do I do with with this"
HCP,"' We tightened a lot of processes up and things like that, as is the world that company decided they didn't want to continue on"
HCP, Erm and they sold it on to somebody well when I say sold it on it sold through the NHS contracts and things like that didn't stuff
HCP, So they gave the contract up the another company came in and they decided they didn't want me
HCP," So I went went back to what I was doing before and going round policing practices and got bit fed up with that again, because I'd been really good with doing like clinical work and now and and then I was going back to not really seeing people"
HCP," Erm went and did a stint at a CCG as a senior medicines optimization pharmacist for a couple of years, and then a practice manager that I knew was like, come back, come back to us and they employed me coming up to four years ago, and I've never looked back"
HCP, So that's a little bit of my background that that is the original cohort really of kind of putting in practice
HCP, Now PCN pharmacists come from a wide range of backgrounds
HCP, You've got community
KAM,Don't mind me I'm jut making notes whilst your talking yeah
HCP,"No worry, So you've got community pharmacists so they've got a strong background in dispensing and minor ailments and things like that, but may not have the strongest erm footing in terms of clinical knowledge"
HCP," Then you've got hospital pharmacists erm they are a little bit stronger in terms of their clinical knowledge, but maybe less so in terms of making on the spot decisions, if that makes sense, because they're often"
KAM,"Yeah, there behind closed doors arent they"
HCP,Does that make sense
KAM,Yeah it does because doors were as compared to community pharmacies that will have a patient in front of them who might need some advice straight away they and have to think on the spot
HCP,"They have to filter through everything that's happening, and sort of go right"
HCP, Is this something that needs to go to the GP
HCP, Is this something I can provide a product for
HCP,What advice do I need to give
HCP," I have to you know on the spot kind of decisions, whereas with hospital, you often have, you're often part of a bigger team and have got, you know, you on the spot, things are a little bit less"
HCP," So yeah, and in terms, but they'll be stronger, really, in terms of the clinical knowledge because they're working in that kind of area"
KAM,"That's something I have found Samantha because when I worked in secondary care, and I did presentations to the pharmacists in secondary care, or in hospitals, they were more clued up with their clinical data, they wanted the ins and the outs of the data"
KAM, They wanted me to take them through the set up of the trial and so on
KAM, So they were definitely very engaged
KAM, That's
HCP,"Oh, it's great fun when we, when I was working in hospital, we used to adore ripping the data apart, and just finding all the little bits and crannys"
HCP," It always is used to sort of like we won't just take things at face value and often Yeah, and often, a lot of hospital pharmacists will have done clinical diplomas as well and part of that, no we do do it university as well in terms of understanding the data, but you know, erm it is a bit more so a PCN so a pharmacist role in primary care, sort of moving on a little bit more to what you actually wanted, as opposed to about me, is so wide ranging"
HCP," Okay, there is no one size fits all"
HCP," It is all very much geared up around supporting the individual practice and the individual pcn, so it depends what the priorities are for that practice"
KAM,"That was my next question actually, I was going to ask you, I did a bit of research and I realized that you fall under East PCN, which is one of seven, and I was going to ask you, but I just I has a little look at it and I was trying to work out"
KAM, But what is your specific role within the practice that you're with at the moment
KAM, Because my understanding is of two other clinical pharmacists as well
HCP,There is that's right
HCP, So there is so
KAM,"I wanted to see, you've got big capacity haven't you in terms of you don't normally find that and why is that what do you do in that particular set up"
HCP,So my practice is a bit different
HCP," We've always been forward thinking we're a big practice, we're 23,000 patients"
HCP," Erm so there is a lot of work when I was bought on four years ago, I was brought on to release GP time"
HCP," So to the I would be doing full day, full day clinics, seeing patients in the room next to the GP, and doing titration of like blood pressure medications, and following up annual reviews discussing cholesterol results"
HCP, Erm I would quite often I would see patients with AF or newly diagnosed AF going through what that risk means
HCP, Using patient decision aids going through what the numbers mean
HCP, What does it mean
HCP, These are the options where do you want to go with it
HCP," Erm prescription queries, respiratory, hospital discharges, hospital letter reconciliation, overall prescription processes, and prescribing safety as well"
HCP," So we were sort of very much in terms of how we monitor the doacs ongoing, because the number of patients on them is rising exponentially"
HCP, Erm and to to make sure that we're doing the information
HCP," I mean, if if I look back to about six years ago, I had maybe 60 patients on DOAC's in a 1000 patient practice, it would take me two full days to pull the data review everything and do a review of it"
HCP," We've got upwards of 400 now, that's a lot of time"
HCP," When you think of how you're doing it and it's not an easy process because of the Craftsman clearance bit It's not the easiest process in the world, you can't just plug it all into a spreadsheet and auto format it, you do have to kind of do it"
HCP," But and then on top of that we've got a lot of other prescribe, prescribing safety things that we have to look at"
HCP, So we do that
HCP," So how it works at my practice is I erm I don't have the official title of lead pharmacist or anything like that, but I kind of am"
HCP, Erm I have my pharmacy team
HCP, So my pharmacy team is actually even bigger than what you found
HCP," So I've got a pharmacy technician and medicines manager as well in my team, as well as the two pcn pharmacists"
HCP, So one of my PCN pharmacist was employed last year
HCP, Erm and she was covering three practices unti l the pcn made the decision to employ more pharmacists and those came online about two months ago
HCP, So she's only recently come back to me full time
HCP," Okay, erm, and we've, we've just recently had her review, actually, and to see the change in confidence and how she's doing things"
HCP," I can throw certain things at her and she, she'll take it and run and do things"
HCP, Erm it's brilliant
HCP," It's brilliant to see, to see that"
HCP," And then my second PCM pharmacist, I've only had about eight weeks"
HCP," So we're very much building up from, you know, building up what she can do, making sure she understands everybody's roles within the practice"
HCP, Yeah
HCP," Erm so, so yeah, so I'm I'm a little bit different"
HCP, Our practice is a little bit different
HCP, I don't know if you looked at the rest of our practice
HCP," Erm we've got a mental health nurse, paramedics, ANPs, practice nurses, HCA's, care navigator"
HCP,And we were doing that before the PCNs or anything like that
HCP," The these are all other than the two PCN pharmacists, and our social prescribing link workers"
HCP," Everybody else is employed by the practice, we're very much believe in multi disciplinary approach to, to our patient care, because our patients are demanding we're in a very deprived area erm have a look Google biker and shields road"
HCP, And you'll see how deprived we are
KAM,Alright okay
KAM, I used to watch biker guys a long time ago not that that was very deprived
HCP,"But yeah, wasn't actually, that wasn't actually based in biker that was in other side of the city"
HCP, So there's lots of different things
KAM,What do you enjoy most about your role
KAM, At the moment
HCP,"Well everything's a bit weird at the minute, obviously, with COVID"
HCP," So we're having we're not having much face to face contact, it's all over the phone, which is causing its own situations"
HCP," Erm but I do love that patient contact, I love speaking to patients, and understanding what is their priorities and what's important to them, and how we can change that"
HCP," Erm what we can do to try and help with what she's with what they want and also trying to engage them in, in bettering their own health and self care"
HCP, And sometimes being really quite blunt with them
HCP," I don't pull punches sometimes and just go look, there's no inhaler in the world that's going to make you breathing better, you've got to stop smoking, if you want that to happen"
HCP, Erm or in terms of sort of DOACs sort of go sitting there with their HAS-BLED scores and going look your HAS-BLED is three
HCP," We can reduce that to two because we're going to stop the aspirin when we start the DOAC but for you to get from two to one, you need to bring your alcohol level down"
HCP," And you know some people are like, Oh, is that and they might look at the risk and go actually I'm happy with it HAS-BLED of two compared to a transfer score of four"
HCP," I'm happy to take that risk and others see it as a alright, yes, no, that's really important and we'll bring it down again"
HCP, So it's a wake up call
HCP," So there's a lot of different things, motivational interviewing, you know, different techniques and things that we use not just so that you get a balanced idea"
HCP," You know, that is our practice, we are a little bit different, a little bit more stand out"
HCP," There are practices like that around the country as well but they're not necessarily the norm, what you're more likely to see is one pcn pharmacist who may not be at the level I'm at, may be starting that 18 month program"
HCP," So getting their feet in there, in what primary care is what you know, and there's no easy way of explaining what primary care is to anybody"
HCP," So trying to understand what that is, and try and getting their feet, building relationships with the GPS, getting that trust issue pro in and then trying to work out what it is they need to do"
HCP," Okay, so you've got the DES sitting there saying you've got to do the safety stuff, you've got to do the SMRs and things like that"
HCP, But how does that actually fit in with what the practice wants
HCP, And what how do they feel I'm a bit of a jack of all trades
HCP," I see myself generally as a general, general practice pharmacist, I've got, you know, I've got quite a good range of things"
HCP," But somebody starting off and somebody getting their feet and somebody has a new prescriber may only want to do diabetes, or may only feel confident in that, or respiratory or cardiac or some other things like that, that might be the priority for the for the practice, as well as a few other bits and pieces that they get involved with"
HCP," So if you if I put all of our our pharmacists within the pcn into one room, and we went round and said what we were doing, some of it would be similar, there'd be certain similar things to it"
HCP, But there'll be a lot of differences within within there as well
KAM,So it's about having that discussion and finding out what each person is doing within that particular practice
HCP,Finding out what people are doing
HCP, Yeah and you've obviously looked so you've obviously looked me up and had a little look and I would hope
KAM,"I hope you wouldn't mind but I normally if I was meeting up with a customer I'd normally Google them and check their profile out look at what the background is and so on just because it helps me understand where we want to or what areas you want to discuss or focus on, and also it helps me you know, repore build or understand that person a bit better"
HCP,"Yeah, I think that really is helpful when somebody when somebody comes in and has a base understanding of what your doing"
HCP," Erm you know, when COVID first kicked off, erm I this probably puts me in a bad light ripping a rep to shreds because they rang up to tell did I want to know about"
HCP," Firstly, they got through by saying that they were from the respiratory department"
HCP," So they got through erm reception to me and did I want to know about this, this new product"
HCP, and I'm like 'Are you kidding me
HCP,' Do you know what's going on right now
HCP, And you want to do that
KAM,Yeah well all I can tell you about that is a hope they weren't from Pfizer and if they were I apolagies on their behalf as we were told from a company perspective that we're gonna cease all contact and the company have been absolutely brilliant that they haven't been putting pressure on the reps to go out and see this number of customers
KAM," Because at the end of the day, we've got families around us that are suffering and struggling with COVID and it's about, it's about the human aspect of it and bring it to light forget about your day job"
KAM," You've got people who were you know, we've had GPS in our local that we've known for years, who unfortunately have passed away with COVID"
KAM," So it's about you know, what your what's important in terms of you and your values and the right thing to do at the right time"
KAM, And I think everybody in here will advise it wasn't the right time to be engaging with customers
KAM,"And even though I'm quite cautious and you know, the impact of COVID has been huge, and it will be in the future as well for everybody"
KAM," To the little kiddies down there who can't understand why their not at school to you know, elderly neighbors I've got who are like I can't see my family and friends and you know, are isolated on their own"
KAM," So I spent my time my time in lockdown doing a lot of online learning a lot of research and doing a bit of baking as well, I must admit and dropping things off to my elderly neighbors like making dinner and dropping off food or making little handwritten cards with the kids and things like that just to lift their spirits up and that's continued even now and we haven't stopped doing that and I think that's, that's what COVID has brought out in a lot of people I think it's brought out the humanity side of things"
KAM, And the little things make a big difference
KAM," Yeah, that's my personal feelings about it all erm but I think we're gonna have to close at the moment, isn't it"
KAM, Are their any questions you would like to ask me at all
HCP,I don't think so
HCP," Um, it was very nice talking to you and being engaged with everything"
KAM,You've got a busy old morning haven't you you've got three of my colleagues straight after this
HCP,"Yeah, I've got one more now and then I've got a break until this afternoon"
KAM,"Okay, brilliant"
KAM, Thank you so much for your time it's been a really useful talk about your role
KAM, And I shall use it to help me better understand the relationships that I build with the clinical pharmacists in my area
KAM," And you're right I've come across perscribers this already, and I've met a few that are very early on in their career and just starting to get that confidence and build it up"
KAM, So it's great to hear from somebody who's right at the top of their game
KAM, Good luck to you in the future I hope it goes well
KAM," Thank you, and have a good afternoon"
KAM, Take care
HCP,Thank you
KAM,Bye bye
