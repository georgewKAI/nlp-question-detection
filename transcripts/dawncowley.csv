KAM,"Hillary Hi, I would Oh, thank you very much, Hillary"
KAM, My name is Dawn
KAM, And I obviously work for Pfizer
KAM, I actually promote Eliquis for non valvular AF
KAM," So in the in the arena of anticoagulation, just so that you know what I do I actually work on the area that covers your geography in your area, as well"
KAM, So it's lovely to meet you
KAM, I live a lot further south
KAM, I live from south of the tyne
KAM, Right
KAM, So I'm right down below below the tyne
KAM," But yeah, it's lovely to meet you"
KAM," So so I'm just hoping we and or we can just, we would normally share things on the screen"
KAM," And obviously, we can't do that today"
KAM," So I just wondered if if, you know, well, first of all, Has everybody been okay due to the COVID"
KAM, And how are you getting on with all of that
HCP,Yeah doing ok I think um in primary care
HCP," We think everything just stepped up last week, in terms of as of last Wednesday, I think the expectation was that primary care itself wouldn't be getting the Pfizer vaccine, we'd be getting the the Oxford one"
HCP, And then that changed on Thursday
HCP, Right
HCP, I didn't get your back ya sites up and running for the 14th
HCP," And it's like, Okay"
KAM,Okay
KAM," Ah, so, so it is it"
KAM, So you feel like you've been thrown a lot of different challenges this year
HCP,Yeah
HCP," But in some ways, it's, it's good as well"
HCP, And I think it's moved things a lot forward in terms of your digital use of digital technology
HCP," And people can no longer say, Oh, we can't do that"
HCP," Because Yeah, so that's being thrown out the window"
HCP, So I think it's about making sure we don't go back to the old ways
HCP," And but also, I think, for me, this is like getting that balance at the moment between sort of vaccinating everybody, but making sure you provide a service, continued service to patients so that you have a sort of the wave of illness coming through and a few months time, which we start to get"
KAM,"Yeah, it's hard, isn't it through the winter"
KAM," So yeah, so So that said, we, you know, obviously, the conversation we can have is about maybe we can support you in some areas"
KAM," And I don't know if in your role, and if you could let me know if there's anything that you feel we could support you"
KAM," We are obviously looking at anticoagulation, and particularly some of the national policy work that can go on around detects protects perfect in that area"
KAM, Yeah
KAM, Have you heard of that one
KAM," And so, you know, obviously, we've got various resources"
KAM," And I don't know where you're at with with that locally with that agenda, or is it has it changed"
HCP,It's it's changed a bit
HCP," And as in my role as manager of the hadrian Primary Care alliance, the Federation, we well, for the last several years have had been commissioned by the CCG to provide a warfarin INR monitoring service"
HCP, And so we've got six practices doing that
HCP," And that's under an AQP, Any qualified provider"
KAM,Yeah
KAM, Yeah
HCP,"Obviously, with COVID Yeah, we've it's accelerated the move to moving everybody"
HCP," Well, all that we can move on to Noax"
HCP," Um, obviously, there's a small number that we that would weigh in on warfarin"
HCP," And I think what we've talked about a lot, we haven't looked into it any further, is, okay, from a pure warfarin perspective, you know, small numbers, it's your financially it's, it's not really feasible, but it's really important service particuarly at practice level, because we cover such a huge geographic area that it would disadvantage patients"
HCP,"So we've met we've decided as a group, it's important to keep that but also looking at is there potential for providing actually an an anticoagulation monitoring service, not just linked to warfarin"
HCP, Yes
HCP," This unless he know about it, I think there's an assumption that once people on onset have noax or DOACs, then it's actually Yes, that's it"
HCP," Well, actually, they still need monitoring"
KAM,"Yes, they do"
KAM," Yes, they do"
KAM, Yeah
KAM, Yeah
KAM, So it's it
KAM," Yes, you're right"
KAM, It's moving it from just a warfarin service to an actual anticoagulation service
KAM, Yeah
KAM, So yeah
KAM," So wherever, you know, you've got to with that, you know, I don't know whether there's may be some areas we can help, you know, certain surgeries with"
KAM," There's all sorts of things, maybe even prioritizing the numbers if they haven't quite looked at them yet, you know, at a local level, and, and maybe ensure the benefit of the outcomes for the patients that prioritize those those numbers and how to just incorporate that into the normal practice pharmacist review"
KAM, And that might already be going on
KAM," And we've got things like we've got, we've gone virtual as much as we can, and going down that road well as like to say, so we have things like patient leaflets that are available online now"
KAM," And obviously, there's education, if anybody wanted any, getting on the usual, you know, local constant, permanent upskilling, or just just upskilling on things like dosing and as you say monitoring and what the requirements are, etc"
KAM," So, you know, you'll be in a position to know if there are practices that might benefit from that or Yeah"
KAM, Anything you think we could help with
HCP,"Well, I think in terms of sort of the anticoagulation monitoring service, obviously, that's something we need to develop and really right at the start of, sort of scoping it because that would apply to all the practices within the locality"
HCP," So that's 14 practices, whereas in terms of the INR monitoring that's just provides by six"
HCP, Yeah
HCP," And so it's, as opposed to just at the stage of sort of scoping that and looking at what it could be, and but also thinking, Well, actually, who would commission it"
HCP, And how would it get commissioned and all that that side of thing
HCP," So like, understanding Well, at the moment, but sort of like who provides that service"
HCP," Is it and I know it's not a good practice level it's sort of how can we provide a service outside of practices, that takes the pressure off practices to do is really right at the start of that process"
KAM,Right
KAM, Okay
KAM," Yeah, yes"
KAM," Yeah, do it outside of the normal work"
KAM, So you don't you don't see it
KAM, Yeah
KAM," So it's a separate piece of work, you don't see it as something that's going to be done within the normal realms of say that, say the review practice the pharmacist, etc, that are going on"
HCP,"Well, I don't know whether or not where we are, there's not much practice pharmacist input"
HCP, So it's very much been nurses and probably GP's that are doing it and that things are needed to actually establish
HCP, And I'm in terms of pharmacist input
HCP," I mean, we sit through the pcn is starting to get more pharmacists, but they're obviously focusing at the moment on, you know, the medication reviews, particularly in relation to sort of care homes"
HCP," And and then we've got a clinical support unit, a centralized clinical support unit to take the pressure off individual practices, and thoughts of service"
HCP, Service
KAM,Yeah
KAM, Yeah
KAM, So yeah
KAM," So you're right at the beginning, really, of trying to work out how we're going to go forward into next year with the DPP thing really,"
HCP,Whats DPP
KAM,detects protects prevents
HCP,"Yes, sorry"
HCP, Sorry
KAM,So you're right at the beginning of that is thinking about next year for the long term plan
HCP,"It is sort of certainly a CCG wide priority, because I think we've had low prevalence, but compared to what our members have detected, is lower than the expected prevalence"
HCP,"And so I think there's quite a few things being done, sort of, from a CCG perspective, but it's like everything"
HCP," Preventative, and it's sort of like feels as if it's on hold with COVID"
HCP," And it's, which is quite worrying in a way that was sort of like the sweet thing, isn't it"
KAM,Yeah
KAM, Because it was doing so well
KAM," Everything was gone along quite so well on on preventative, and all sorts of areas wasnt it"
KAM, Not just cardiovascular but everything
HCP,"Yeah, that's, and that is really worrying in the sense that Yeah, we've got to get it, you know, sort of like the vaccination done but at what cost"
HCP, Yes
HCP, To all the other to really the Prevention Agenda
HCP," And that's that is it that's a fine line between balancing,"
KAM,balancing it
KAM, Yeah
KAM, Yeah
KAM," So as well we do have we do have sort of things I said that I would have shown you that kind of highlight the you know, the the by optimizing that management in the detect, etc, you know how the benefits to the patient prevention etc"
KAM," And then the follow on benefit, obviously, of the cost of the patient of having a stroke and the wider health care cost of having a stroke"
KAM," So we've got all of that, that we could share with you in a different on a different day"
KAM," And also, you know, colleagues who colleague who have other kind of computer models, if you like that, you know, help you to look at patient pathways and prioritize in terms of what the outcomes are in terms of quality metric"
KAM," So there's a few different different colleagues that we have that if we were interested, we could bring in and just to show you and give you a flavor of what to do when a piece of work would, could result in and it kind of when you're sort of pushed, as you say, for choosing resource and and balancing that it might help you to do that"
KAM," Yes, or we can, you know, but obviously, we can't do that today"
KAM, I can't share
KAM," And then as I say this, the other the other issue of the on the ground support, if there was anybody else that you thought would benefit from a conversation around, you know, with the actual direct data, monitoring the lift to the doors, and etc"
KAM, And so there's a few different things
HCP,"And do you do and sort of training as well, because we obviously, I'm in the, in the West locality"
HCP," I think we're the only locality in Northumberland, that that we do and resolve timeout events"
HCP," This year, they were obviously done"
KAM,"Yes, I have supported those in the past until this year, we've missed them"
HCP,So we've gone that we've done our second one remotely
HCP, umm
KAM,"yeah, well done"
KAM, But do you think you're gonna do them like that in the future
HCP,"Like, certainly, for the for going forward"
HCP," But it's, it's actually open more opportunities, because one of particularly things with nurses in the sense that I think, up until now, practice, although the timeout events have been for all staff, and we hold parallel variety of sessions for GPS, this is admin and managers"
HCP, I think that sometimes practice managers unless it's related to that nurses job can be reluctant to let nurses end
HCP," Yeah, yeah"
HCP," And I can understand that, to some extent it"
HCP," And particularly if you're from a small practice, where you're nursing resources, perhaps you're very limited as it is"
HCP," But I think there's the opportunity now to do things at times, that with that person's job that allows them to attend"
HCP," So we're about to do survey in January, looking at actually what's actually needed in the year, what would people like to do"
HCP, So that we can put on a range of things at different times
HCP, I think its although remote is certainly has its challenges
HCP, I think it also provides more opportunities
HCP, Yeah
KAM,"Tt does it has done we've done that as well with in I see what your saying about training, we've had consult we now do sort of consultants speaking"
KAM," And, you know all times of the day, you know, early morning lunchtime, like after work, and it does seem to suit some people, you can put things on at different times, give them a couple of different opportunities to listen"
KAM," And so yeah, so yes, on from that side, yes, we can sort of source you know, the local, you know, specialist in that area"
KAM," If, and, obviously, we've got to go through some compliance, hoops, and all of that, and, you know, do it all properly"
KAM," But yes, we can get the consultant to maybe, if it wasn't a therapy area that you felt would know, they would benefit from a talk and an interactive sort of session with"
KAM, Yeah
HCP,"I mean, just because there's so many opportunities there because you people don't have to travel to get to an event"
HCP, And enables experts who may not live anywhere near you to two partiesas well
KAM,"Yes, that's right"
KAM," We've had more we've had more interaction from sort of up and down the country to things, you know, you normally wouldn't obviously, um and then people can also dip in and dip out, as they say, it's not the commitment to travel or be there for the whole afternoon is not there anymore, is it"
KAM, It's you could dip into that section that is relevant to you
KAM, So to have something else that maybe we can think about to work together on and for next year
KAM, If you think there's something we can support
KAM, Yeah
KAM, Yeah
KAM," Yeah, that would be good"
HCP,"because I think on some, you know, we tend to do a focused event"
HCP, So last week's was on palliative care
HCP," And I think sometimes it helps that to have a topic area with it, whereas the other ones in The olden days pre COVID were like three hours"
HCP, I think we keep them much shorter now
HCP, Yeah
KAM,"short, sharp"
KAM, Yeah
KAM," Yeah, yeah"
KAM, And everybody's getting very good
KAM," Get very good at the tech and the digital capability, aren't we"
HCP, Sometimes in the wilds of Northumberland having a good a good internet isn't always work unfortunately
KAM,"Nor do you know what I have such a funny, I live near the city center near Newcastle city centre and my internet is dreadful phone the IT guy and he'll say what do you live in rural"
KAM," I'm saying no, no"
KAM, City Centre
KAM, I've got dreadful internet
KAM," So no, it's really difficult"
KAM, Isn't it
KAM," Really, really difficult"
KAM, Yeah
KAM," Oh, sorry"
KAM," I think oh, I don't know if our time is up"
KAM, And I still hear somebody speaking there
KAM, I don't know
KAM," No, Tracy there"
KAM," No, she's not there"
KAM, I thought I heard somebody in the background
KAM," Oh, dear"
KAM, So so yes
KAM, And that will be great
KAM, If maybe we catch up again
KAM, Yeah
KAM," And see, and see where we're at and sought out for next year about some what you're going to do next year"
KAM," That's really interesting, isn't it with"
KAM, So so everything else that you're doing
KAM," It's really difficult, isn't it to balance"
KAM," And all I can say is when I've spoken to other people in other areas, they're finding the same story, isn't it"
KAM, It's hard to juggle everything and prioritize
KAM, Yeah
KAM, And so hopefully we can we can be of support with some of that
KAM, Going into next year
KAM, Yeah
KAM,Are you there trace
KAM,Are you there
KAM, Tracy
KAM, She's gone
KAM, She's gone
KAM, Because I know you've got another call in five minutes
KAM, I wanted to give you a little bit of time
HCP,"It was awesome that such like, is that awful moment when you think oh, no they cant hear you and he's like, Oh, god,"
KAM,"It is awful, isn't it"
KAM," And you know, it happens it all it happens often on the WebEx and I don't know really why"
KAM, And also is is he suddenly then it suddenly works
KAM," And you think, oh, what did I do there"
HCP,"Yeah, it's not always make it work"
KAM,"Well, because we always do a practice run"
KAM, And then we do the practice run and it works
KAM," And the next day it doesn't, you know, it's a little bit a little bit frustrating"
KAM, But do you use teams and things as well
HCP,Yes
HCP, And teams and zoom
HCP," Teams in the NHS, across the PCN we tend to use zoom only because we can get more people seeing same people"
HCP," Because 14 practices i think to be able to see facesis is at board meetings is important it when you just sort of a little icon on the screen, and you can't see that person it can make it"
HCP, It makes it more difficult
HCP, Yeah
HCP," And I find it weird thinking, Can people see me or can they not"
HCP, And
KAM,"yeah, it is it is a funny, it's a funny thing to get used to, I think this is part of this thing that we're doing now is trying to make us better at it"
KAM," It's also the opportunity to practice as well, because surgeries are so busy on the That's it, we haven't had huge amounts of opportunities"
KAM," So it's it's it's difficult, as you say, we're going to be working like this"
KAM," Do you see this continuing into next year, this virtual working more than even once things have settled a little bit"
HCP,"I think for most of next year, because I think in terms of vaccinations, it's it's going to take I mean, the enhanced service that came out that lasts until 31st of August, so they're not expecting it quick"
HCP, And what you don't know is how long any of the vaccines are gonna last
HCP, So I think there's still going to be a need for social distancing
HCP," And yeah, very challenging for practices"
KAM,"Yeah, caution until next year, all the way through"
KAM," So yeah, yes"
KAM," It's how to how to manage, as you say these, the clinics and the getting the patients through Yeah"
HCP,Yeah
HCP, While at the service
HCP," I think there's a real concern about the effects of it on the workforce, because you're asking them to do it on top of everything else"
HCP, Yeah
HCP, and your not saying stop anything
HCP, Your saying do it all continue to say do that
HCP, Yeah
KAM,"Because they've got because the CBD thing does come into the into it next year, doesn't it"
KAM," The long term plan, you know, and you'll have those milestones to reach"
KAM, Will you those those goals to reach
HCP,And then the moment we don't know what they are
HCP," Yeah,"
KAM,yes
KAM, Yeah
HCP,Do they give you much Notice once you see here it is
HCP, It do
HCP," I mean, I mean, in terms of, obviously with the additional roles, the whole purpose was to recruit those roles to help you deliver"
HCP," And, and we're still waiting Wait, ideally in our area, we want to recruit into paramedic roles and mental community mental health worker roles"
HCP," But they're still umming in arring, and until the contracts decided they're not coming, they're not saying what that job description and also what and what pay scale it is"
HCP," So we can't go out for recruitment, and we need to going out for recruitment now"
HCP, To have them in place for april
KAM,"it's really tricky, really difficult, yet really difficult"
KAM," So it seems like really what we need to try and do is help you to, to do what you need to do within the realms of your current resource Don't we and try and support you as much as we can"
KAM," Yeah, sort of hope for that would be nice to be able to do some of that"
KAM," Throughout the time out, as you say across the across the Federation"
KAM, We can maybe help with some education and stuff
KAM, Yeah
KAM, Good
KAM, Be good
KAM, Yeah
KAM," Oh, and then there's Christmas to get sorted out"
KAM, Isn't there
KAM, got to get past Christmas
KAM, Are you doing a socially distant Christmas
HCP,Probably
HCP," Yeah, I'm not a big Christmas fan anyway, so but I'm promising a partner on Christmas Eve, who's filled to Christmas day and then he's going to his family"
HCP, Yeah
HCP, Yeah
HCP, So and I'll just stay with the dog
HCP," Yeah,"
KAM,yes
KAM, Different
KAM, Very different
KAM, Very different Christmas
KAM, I think this year we've been with no Christmas parties to go to
HCP,"No, well, I'm sort of spot being self employed for 14 years"
HCP, I've I'm not used to Christmas parties anymore
HCP, So I'm not
HCP, I don't feel as if I'm missing out on this year
KAM,"Yes, actually"
KAM, It's all right
KAM, We'll just get used to it
