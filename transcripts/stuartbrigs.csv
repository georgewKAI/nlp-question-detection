KAM,"Hi, Klaus, how you doing, you well"
HCP,"I'm doing alright right sorry, I just come out of one meeting and I went downstairs for roadway"
HCP, And that's why I'm late
HCP, I forgot that we have back to back meetings today
HCP, Not with you guys
HCP, But obviously my other work goes on in the background
HCP," So, yes, what do we need to talk about Stuart"
KAM,Yeah
KAM," Well you know, I'll give you a quick introduction to myself"
KAM," So, yeah, my name is Stuart Briggs"
KAM," So I've worked for Pfizer for Gosh, 24 years now"
HCP,You dont look old enough
KAM,Thank you very much
KAM, I do appreciate that
HCP,You must have started straight out of school
KAM,"Yeah, well, no, I I worked for the sun Alliance for a couple of years before I went into the pharma industry has I've got a life science degree behind that"
KAM," And then I've, since then, I've been I've worked from Pfizer"
KAM, I launched Atorvastatin starting back in 1997
HCP,That's exciting
HCP, Were you for five were you Pfizer or were you Parke Davis
KAM,I was parke Davis
HCP,"Oh, there you go"
KAM,Yeah
KAM," So I was originally Parke Davis, as was my colleague, Dan Feldman, who I think you may have spoken to earlier today"
KAM, I went through that
KAM," And then in terms of cardiology, now I'm involved with the nonvalvular, atrial fibrillation side of things with apixaban"
KAM, But I'm also doing some work with vyndaqel
KAM, But its generic name is Tafamidids for cardiomyopathy
KAM, Right
KAM," So I, I'm not sure if you're aware of that at all"
HCP,Umm kind of
KAM,Yep
KAM," Because I appreciate you within you work within the cardiology field, and you've got interest within heart failure as well, your self havent you"
HCP,Yes
HCP, So I'm a heart failure doctor
HCP," And, and, and I do just, I'm a heart failure doctor"
HCP," So I do pacemakers, and I do"
HCP," So that's, that's kind of how I better but at the time, when atorvastatin launched, I was just a first year registrar and cardiology"
HCP," And then it was, it was an entertaining time, because at the time you launch 10 milligrams of atorvastatin"
HCP," everybody's like, Oh, my God, what's it gonna do"
HCP," And um, And I wrote to the GP's, and they say, well, but the cholesterol, I've got to check the cholesterol"
HCP," I said, No, no, no"
HCP, Just give it to everyone
HCP," And, and then, and, and so I said, anybody who's at a heart attack, anybody who's had angina, anybody's had a stroke just given to 10 milligrams of atorvastatin fire and forget was my standard email and everybody thought I was a nut"
HCP," Now, if you look at what we're doing, we give everybody 18 milligrams of atorvastatin"
HCP," And if you go back to 98 99, youd think to yourself Wow, they wouldn't even of dreamt of the timd, they dont even test cholesterols now"
KAM,"Medicine moves on so quickly, it doesn't turn markable"
KAM," Because they said did you know  one of my colleagues bill barrack, who used to work around the Leeds area for Parke Davis"
HCP,"No, because I was living in"
HCP,"So I Well, first of all, when, when Parke Davis came around came around"
HCP," I first of all, was working in South Wales"
HCP, I was looking Newport
HCP, I don't know
HCP, I don't know who who was the Parke Davis rep in Newport
HCP," But they took me to the very first my very first ESC was Parke Davis stroke, Pfizer in Vienna"
HCP," And I spent a lot of time walking around, I did the very junior registrar thing, which is, I have no idea what's going on"
HCP," So I'm going to go to every evening meal that has been organized, and they organize a tour of Vienna, which was awfully nice of them"
HCP," And I met loads of people that that that week, and and then on my way back from from the flight, in, which was into Heathrow, because there were I mean, it was 1998"
HCP, Right
HCP, So it wasn't like I had to fly to Heathrow
HCP, And I met john cleeland on the flight home
HCP," Who said are Klaus, I've got a I got to review some abstracts"
HCP, He sat on the opposite opposite side of the aisle to me
HCP," He said, well have a look at these abstracts for next years USC see if they're any good"
HCP," And then and they said, oh, by the way, I've got a job going in Hull and in in 12 months time in September 1999"
HCP, And this was obviously September 98
HCP, And that was how I then ended up moving to Hull
HCP, And the Parke Davis guy in Hull
HCP, I can't even remember Paul was his name
HCP," very senior guy, regional manager for Parke Davis in Hull"
HCP," And in early 2000, just when Parke Davis was starting to be swallowed, Paul and his team moved over and we went on the most amazing ACC conference in Los Angeles"
HCP, And when we went we did some stuff that you don't want to know about
HCP, We went to
KAM,its changed times
HCP,We went to Universal Studios
HCP," I think it's possible that Paul Paul, through Pfizer even pay for the entry"
HCP," And which is a very different world nowadays, of course, it was there was no educational value to that trip at all"
HCP," But it was, but it was really good because, and I've talked with this with with Dan about this, and one of the things that we, we've talked that you can kind of do a holding pattern, for relationships between representatives, pharmaceutical industry, and physicians and nurses, you can tell it to a holding pattern, it's very difficult to build relationships over the internet, you can you can work with people you already know, it's quite difficult to start up a new relationship with physically face to face with them"
HCP, And I think that's a challenge going forward for the pharmaceutical industry
HCP," Because you will, increasingly are increasingly at risk of being these guys to come in and want to just sell stuff"
HCP," Whereas before it was a relationship, and you built a relationship around several humans wanting to do the best for other humans"
HCP," And yes, yeah"
HCP," And and now the risk is, is with our cold, unfeeling, non touchy world where we're all in different parts of the world"
HCP," I mean, you could be in, you could be in Timbuktu, no idea where you are"
HCP," And you it's entirely possible, you don't give a toss about me, what you care about is just the bottom line, and you're going to sell more atorvastatin or whatever"
HCP," Yeah, I think that is something that is a challenge going forward"
HCP, How do you build a relationship with people over the internet
KAM,It is it is a challenge
KAM, It is
KAM," It is certainly one of those things we've, I expect we've had to build on it over the last few months, I expect certainly through the COVID times"
KAM, And a big part of it is actually getting the technology right as well
KAM, Yeah making sure that our platforms work with your platforms
KAM," And I know in the NHS, now you're going down and Microsoft Teams routes"
KAM," And at least we can communicate and we can actually speak to you and see you and when we share our screens and share details with you, you can actually see those as well"
KAM, So
HCP,"yes, you're right there are there"
HCP," I mean, if we had tried to do what we do, did give, even 5 or 10 years ago now, we'd be completely stuffed"
HCP, So there are there are possibilities
HCP," Now that wouldn't have existed when you and I first started doing this job, but it's still not I dont think, I don't think it will completely replace face to face meetings"
KAM,"I think it is a tool, isn't it"
KAM," And it's, you know, it's very handy to have when we're unable to be in front of you and so on"
KAM, And you'd like to say my career has changed drastically from those Atorvastatin starting days
KAM, I did ACE inhibitors
KAM, So back in heart failures
KAM," Also I did the Parke Davis, ACE inhibitor in those days was aquapro"
KAM, quinapril
HCP,"Quinapril god, yeah, we used to have these use"
HCP, Quinapril broke quite a bit
HCP," It has some advantages, but didn't last"
KAM,"And then obviously, coming along"
KAM, I've done a Eplerenone mineralocorticoid receptor blockade
KAM," And then like I say, Now, I'm more coming back into heart failure with tafamadis"
KAM, But that's for the transporting cardio stuff
KAM, The amyloid cardiomyopathy
KAM, I don't know if you've been involved with the amyloid cardiomyopathy stuff much
HCP,"I have so soon, I have tried to avoid it"
HCP," It's so rare and so vastly expensive that the, for me the population, I'm kind of a population epidemiology pathway kind of guy"
HCP, Yes
HCP, The the best way of doing stuff that is of no use to the population as a whole
HCP, So I have I have to say that your colleagues have tried to engage me in this whole conversation have been slightly reluctant at the current price for the current outcomes
HCP, It's been a difficult task for them
KAM,"Yes, yes"
KAM, Yeah
KAM," I, you know, I think I'd say, you know, your interests, obviously are lying in other areas"
KAM," And I think it's, like you say it's a rare disease"
KAM, And that's difficult
KAM, Yeah
KAM, And rare diseases take a different path
KAM," They take a different path, that path and I just said this, the centrally commissioned nice makes a recommendation on it"
KAM, And I expect I hope like most areas in every area of medicine we work in is to make sure Difference those patients lives
KAM, Can you extend life in a meaningful way
KAM, Yeah
KAM, Which gives quality of life
KAM, And that's kind of another area that we're working in
KAM," And it's nice, it complements some of our discussions that we're having within the cardiology fields, it adds interest in today's physicians who have got those interests there as well"
HCP,"Yes, and I think it's important in this field, particularly because it's such a personalized part of part of the job that your, your contact with physicians has to be even more of a partnership based arrangement than for example, I want you to use a eplereonone, which is now relatively cheap and should be used in almost everyone"
HCP, And it's a very different approach
HCP," And so your, your approach to physicians has to be almost even more personalized to your particular field is going to be even harder to do online than somebody selling apixaban for example"
KAM,"Yeah, yeah, very much"
KAM," So I'd like to say it's, it's getting the relationships, as well as building relationships over the internet we used to"
KAM," And again, I expect with apixaban"
KAM," It's building relationships with the whole team, not just the consultants, it's the registrar's it's the is the nurse consultants, it's the junior doctors"
KAM," And it's how it all fits together and coming to see you in your office is one thing, but he says we walk out to your office as well, and we bump into somebody else that you would Yeah, he says to another, if that doesn't happen quite as much"
HCP,"Yeah, and that's it, that's one of the challenges for these one to one meetings is that you're not allowed to come into the hospital anymore, and just get the odd cup of coffee"
HCP," And then three people sit down together, you can reach the whole team at once, or you can arrange to meet the whole team at once"
HCP," And you can form a partnership with, with with with a whole range of the pathway, that's guessing"
KAM,Right
KAM," And I say that COVID has given its own limitations to what you can do as well in the in the hospital, assuming you must have some real impact with your, with your patient interactions surely"
HCP,"So on a lot a normal a lot of the work we do now is on the telephone, which is quite wrong, because it's quite hard to know what their pulses, you can't increase the load, you can't increase the beta blocker until you know what their pulse is"
HCP, So that's a challenge
HCP, And but it can be done
HCP, It's just we've been slightly resistant to it
HCP," And actually, our patients don't quite like seeing us they are scared of COVID because that's what they want us to be they want us to be scared otherwise we'd all be out partying and buying beer"
HCP," So to some extent, of course, the fear, is part of the strategy to control the virus"
HCP," So the patients are all very scared, and which is limited our research capacity because we can't do clinical research on them without seeing them that really is difficult"
HCP," Yes, you can see the medical management, it can be done"
HCP, It's just the volume is much lower because people are presenting with heart failure they're presenting with they're not coming to hospital as they are we're just waiting to see see how so the the diagnosis has gone down
HCP," And but those that do get diagnosed, we can actually do reasonably okay"
HCP," I remember you know, it's interesting that you were you were a eplerenone"
HCP," I remember when many many, many years ago, the ephassis study was launched and I was a research fellow in Hull and we we did ephassis in Hull and, I went to the investigators meeting"
HCP," And then we completed the study and then I went to the launch meeting with Pfizer as it was then yes, and and I possess so the whole so a epleronone is really the study the drug that I kind of watched, come through from dinner, sometimes ridiculous idea to eventually being being approved"
HCP," And then we did a we did it, we did a HTA health economic analysis on it"
HCP, And that was the first my my my first foray into health economic analysis
HCP," So I do have some relationship with a Eplerenone as well, which is kind of funny"
KAM,A few links with our company
HCP,"Yeah, absolutely"
HCP," I mean, I in fact, it may be it may in fact, be the when you were about to release your, your blue pill that that I bought a I think I bought for Pfizer shares at that time, and then it got split and split and split again there was all I could afford at the time"
HCP," And, and now I have 65 shares, which is not very many, but they have grown and"
HCP," So so I think So I have a close relationship with Pfizer, I used to keep a close eye on everything that came out of manufacturing and out of the product line in, in North America"
HCP, And I've always been very enthused by the richness of the scene that Pfizer have had and apixaban is only one of those things and you're here
HCP, Your amyloid treatment is of course another since it's really pleasant to see
HCP," And now of course, the COVID vaccine, very manufactured in developed and manufactured in Germany"
HCP, So it's all good
KAM,"It's, you know, it's, like you say, it's exciting times,"
HCP,really exciting times
KAM,"I love working for Pfizer, and it is one of the things that we see is that is a company that has success, and continues to have success and drives patient outcomes and well being for patients"
KAM," And that's a nice part to you know, to be involved with"
KAM, It's fantastic
KAM, I do believe as well at times just about run out
KAM," No, we were told it was about a 15 minute discussion and yes, tight time really does fly by"
HCP,Time flies by so i think so it's really good
HCP, This is a really interesting project because I think it'll really serve to identify what can and what can't be done over the internet and it would be really nice
HCP," And, and your work"
HCP, You're working on it
HCP, You're still you're in the Midlands you said
KAM,"I'm in the middle of it living Grantham, say in Lincolnshire in Grantham"
HCP,"Wow, I've never been to Grantham them but I've been through it on numerous occasions on the train"
KAM,because it's about an hour down the coastline from Leeds isn't
HCP,isn't the you know when you're getting near home because it's Grantham Grantham is on the way home
HCP, When you've had a terrible fight to get on the train at kings cross you get to Grantham and starts quieting down a bit
HCP, Burbidge
HCP, You used to have to do a lot of driving then before
KAM,"Oh, yeah, I would have driven probably, I don't know"
KAM, Considerable miles each day
KAM," I expect because I work and live in Lincolnshire, and I expect up to the county hospital in Lincoln will be about an 80 mile return trip"
KAM," But yeah, it varies"
KAM," And certainly if we're traveling out to into darbyshire into the peaks got to royal, the Royal Hospital in Chesterfield"
KAM, Yeah
KAM, I don't think our territories are quite as large as they used to be back in the Parke Davis days
KAM,So we do seem to now have smaller territories less time actually on the road and more opportunity to be in the hospital in front of our customers in normal times obviously
KAM, So we look forward to coming back and do a bit more of that
HCP,All right
HCP," Well, I hope you have a I have to have an entertaining day"
HCP, Do you have any more meetings today
HCP," I guess, I guess there's some Pfizer thing going on in the background that you're gonna have to log back into"
KAM,Yeah
KAM, I haven't got an awful lot more other than my general day job at the moment
KAM," This, not for this project"
KAM," But yes, we keep ourselves busy"
KAM, All right
KAM, Thank you very much
KAM, It's been a great time having a chat and we'll connect again
KAM," Yeah, I'm sure we will sometime"
KAM, Thanks a lot again
HCP,Take care
HCP, Bye bye bye
