"Hillary Hi, I would Oh, thank you very much, Hillary"
Yeah doing ok I think um in primary care
" We think everything just stepped up last week, in terms of as of last Wednesday, I think the expectation was that primary care itself wouldn't be getting the Pfizer vaccine, we'd be getting the the Oxford one"
 And then that changed on Thursday
 Right
 I didn't get your back ya sites up and running for the 14th
" And it's like, Okay"
Yeah
" But in some ways, it's, it's good as well"
 And I think it's moved things a lot forward in terms of your digital use of digital technology
" And people can no longer say, Oh, we can't do that"
" Because Yeah, so that's being thrown out the window"
 So I think it's about making sure we don't go back to the old ways
" And but also, I think, for me, this is like getting that balance at the moment between sort of vaccinating everybody, but making sure you provide a service, continued service to patients so that you have a sort of the wave of illness coming through and a few months time, which we start to get"
It's it's changed a bit
" And as in my role as manager of the hadrian Primary Care alliance, the Federation, we well, for the last several years have had been commissioned by the CCG to provide a warfarin INR monitoring service"
 And so we've got six practices doing that
" And that's under an AQP, Any qualified provider"
"Obviously, with COVID Yeah, we've it's accelerated the move to moving everybody"
" Well, all that we can move on to Noax"
" Um, obviously, there's a small number that we that would weigh in on warfarin"
" And I think what we've talked about a lot, we haven't looked into it any further, is, okay, from a pure warfarin perspective, you know, small numbers, it's your financially it's, it's not really feasible, but it's really important service particuarly at practice level, because we cover such a huge geographic area that it would disadvantage patients"
"So we've met we've decided as a group, it's important to keep that but also looking at is there potential for providing actually an an anticoagulation monitoring service, not just linked to warfarin"
 Yes
" This unless he know about it, I think there's an assumption that once people on onset have noax or DOACs, then it's actually Yes, that's it"
" Well, actually, they still need monitoring"
"Well, I think in terms of sort of the anticoagulation monitoring service, obviously, that's something we need to develop and really right at the start of, sort of scoping it because that would apply to all the practices within the locality"
" So that's 14 practices, whereas in terms of the INR monitoring that's just provides by six"
 Yeah
" And so it's, as opposed to just at the stage of sort of scoping that and looking at what it could be, and but also thinking, Well, actually, who would commission it"
 And how would it get commissioned and all that that side of thing
" So like, understanding Well, at the moment, but sort of like who provides that service"
" Is it and I know it's not a good practice level it's sort of how can we provide a service outside of practices, that takes the pressure off practices to do is really right at the start of that process"
"Well, I don't know whether or not where we are, there's not much practice pharmacist input"
 So it's very much been nurses and probably GP's that are doing it and that things are needed to actually establish
 And I'm in terms of pharmacist input
" I mean, we sit through the pcn is starting to get more pharmacists, but they're obviously focusing at the moment on, you know, the medication reviews, particularly in relation to sort of care homes"
" And and then we've got a clinical support unit, a centralized clinical support unit to take the pressure off individual practices, and thoughts of service"
 Service
Whats DPP
"Yes, sorry"
 Sorry
"It is sort of certainly a CCG wide priority, because I think we've had low prevalence, but compared to what our members have detected, is lower than the expected prevalence"
"And so I think there's quite a few things being done, sort of, from a CCG perspective, but it's like everything"
" Preventative, and it's sort of like feels as if it's on hold with COVID"
" And it's, which is quite worrying in a way that was sort of like the sweet thing, isn't it"
"Yeah, that's, and that is really worrying in the sense that Yeah, we've got to get it, you know, sort of like the vaccination done but at what cost"
 Yes
 To all the other to really the Prevention Agenda
" And that's that is it that's a fine line between balancing,"
"And do you do and sort of training as well, because we obviously, I'm in the, in the West locality"
" I think we're the only locality in Northumberland, that that we do and resolve timeout events"
" This year, they were obviously done"
So we've gone that we've done our second one remotely
 umm
"Like, certainly, for the for going forward"
" But it's, it's actually open more opportunities, because one of particularly things with nurses in the sense that I think, up until now, practice, although the timeout events have been for all staff, and we hold parallel variety of sessions for GPS, this is admin and managers"
 I think that sometimes practice managers unless it's related to that nurses job can be reluctant to let nurses end
" Yeah, yeah"
" And I can understand that, to some extent it"
" And particularly if you're from a small practice, where you're nursing resources, perhaps you're very limited as it is"
" But I think there's the opportunity now to do things at times, that with that person's job that allows them to attend"
" So we're about to do survey in January, looking at actually what's actually needed in the year, what would people like to do"
 So that we can put on a range of things at different times
 I think its although remote is certainly has its challenges
 I think it also provides more opportunities
 Yeah
"I mean, just because there's so many opportunities there because you people don't have to travel to get to an event"
 And enables experts who may not live anywhere near you to two partiesas well
"because I think on some, you know, we tend to do a focused event"
 So last week's was on palliative care
" And I think sometimes it helps that to have a topic area with it, whereas the other ones in The olden days pre COVID were like three hours"
 I think we keep them much shorter now
 Yeah
 Sometimes in the wilds of Northumberland having a good a good internet isn't always work unfortunately
"It was awesome that such like, is that awful moment when you think oh, no they cant hear you and he's like, Oh, god,"
"Yeah, it's not always make it work"
Yes
 And teams and zoom
" Teams in the NHS, across the PCN we tend to use zoom only because we can get more people seeing same people"
" Because 14 practices i think to be able to see facesis is at board meetings is important it when you just sort of a little icon on the screen, and you can't see that person it can make it"
 It makes it more difficult
 Yeah
" And I find it weird thinking, Can people see me or can they not"
 And
"I think for most of next year, because I think in terms of vaccinations, it's it's going to take I mean, the enhanced service that came out that lasts until 31st of August, so they're not expecting it quick"
 And what you don't know is how long any of the vaccines are gonna last
 So I think there's still going to be a need for social distancing
" And yeah, very challenging for practices"
Yeah
 While at the service
" I think there's a real concern about the effects of it on the workforce, because you're asking them to do it on top of everything else"
 Yeah
 and your not saying stop anything
 Your saying do it all continue to say do that
 Yeah
And then the moment we don't know what they are
" Yeah,"
Do they give you much Notice once you see here it is
 It do
" I mean, I mean, in terms of, obviously with the additional roles, the whole purpose was to recruit those roles to help you deliver"
" And, and we're still waiting Wait, ideally in our area, we want to recruit into paramedic roles and mental community mental health worker roles"
" But they're still umming in arring, and until the contracts decided they're not coming, they're not saying what that job description and also what and what pay scale it is"
" So we can't go out for recruitment, and we need to going out for recruitment now"
 To have them in place for april
Probably
" Yeah, I'm not a big Christmas fan anyway, so but I'm promising a partner on Christmas Eve, who's filled to Christmas day and then he's going to his family"
 Yeah
 Yeah
 So and I'll just stay with the dog
" Yeah,"
"No, well, I'm sort of spot being self employed for 14 years"
 I've I'm not used to Christmas parties anymore
 So I'm not
 I don't feel as if I'm missing out on this year
