Please call me john
" And can I call you, Tariq"
"Exactly, I always associate Pfizer with them with sandwich because, yes, its shrunk a bit, but it's still there"
"Well I think the same as any other large general practice, PCN, you know, we had to change completely everything"
" You know, we've just created a COVID virtual Ward, which involves giving out pulse oximeters to detect silent hypoxia"
 And we're just cranking up to be part of the mass immunization program
" So, yeah, so it's all pretty, pretty busy and completely changed, as it has for everybody"
Yeah I've got several titles
 It's a little bit embarrassing
 I'm GP director of strategy for Whitstable medical practice which is a single practice PCN
" I'm also the PCN, clinical director"
 I do some work with the East Kent ICP as well
 So I've got like a lot of us quite a few titles
" I'm also on the foundation board for the newly founded Kenton memory medical school, which went live September"
" So yeah, like a lot of people"
 I've got a few hats
Okay
 All right
" Well, I mean, we came to being a PCN from the encompass MCP MCP's"
 We're multi professional clinical providers
" Yeah, which was really Simon Stephens ideas, the three year project"
" They were I think nine MCP's and encompass was one of them which I which I chaired and Western medical practice, I think it's fair to say was the heart of that and it actually involved Canterbury Herne Bay Whitstable fathom, not by sorry, whistle favish wing mash sandwich"
" So we looked after about 180,000 people in for what we called hubs, and on the evidence of our MCP, and indeed others up and down the country, the concept of of PCN's was born and what one common thing is a community multidisciplinary team"
" Yeah, the product of which is producing an anticipatory care plan for frail people, typically elderly people, and I use the word anticipatory because yeah, just about the care plan for the here and now"
" It's where inevitably, unfortunately, their condition or conditions worse and what do we do there"
" And yes, absolutely"
"And some people surprised us by saying, I don't actually want to go to hospital, you know, I'm 89"
 I'm gonna stay here
 Thank you and take my chances with you guys
" And it also by creating multidisciplinary teams with one version of the electronic care record, there's much more coordination one version of the truth, one up to date version, rather than every agency having their own version of the of the record"
 And so the transition to from an MCP with hubs to a PCN was a natural transition because return to the former informed the latter so that was quite easy
" The new challenges involve trying to apart quite often COVID of course, and involve trying to engage with the the PCN enhance service, which is Yeah, the sort of a must do at least it is actually voluntary"
" But yeah, you got to start somewhere, you got to start there"
" But most PCN's that are forward thinking, and I hope ours is also a five year strategy written"
" And in our case, that involves trying to develop an awful lot more community integrated healthcare"
" Yeah, is"
" I don't know if you know much about Western medical practice, but we've sort of pioneered this from Blimey, 20 years ago"
"yeah, the concept of hospitals over there in general practice over here always seem mad to me"
" You know, we're one driver medical school"
 Let me turn into two tribes when we get out Yeah
 And qualified
" So we've, we've, we've developed a range of services over a number of years, which you'd normally associate with a trip to hospitals"
" So we have an urgent treatment center with with a full DVT diagnosis and treatment service, ultrasound open six days a week, which actually beats the hospital"
 And we do use apixaban for that
 We're in the same camp already
" But I mean, that that that is we are the only community provider of a community DVT diagnosis and treatment service in wonderful Kent"
" And our lead ACP advanced care practitioner nurse has done a master's in thromboembolism, so embarrassed to say she knows more than the rest of us now"
 So that's good
 But we also have a range of diagnostics
 We have a range of outpatients
 We have an operating theatre where cataract surgery and skin surgery is done
" So we're very much moved into urgent care and elective care of the sort you'd normally have to go to hospital for for a day case or an outpatient, such that more than 50% of our turnover is now community integrated healthcare, the other 50% being GMS"
 So we're a bit of an outlier in that respect
" But it is similar where we were actually in NHS Pathfinder, when there were pathfinders, and it seemed very much as the way forward to try and integrate, rather than have, as I've said, secondary, primary care over here"
" So our challenges as long as to your short question, I apologize"
 our Challenges
"We do indeed, so so our challenge in a nutshell is not really enhanced service, we find that quite easy"
" The challenge is trying to fulfill the the aspirations in our five in our five year strategy with involves developing more outpatients, more diagnostics"
" And yeah, and working hard in the in the urgent care sector as well use the urgent treatment center where we now have, as I say, we we have this DVT service, we have virtual and face to face fracture clinics there"
" And we have a range of point of care blood tests now as well, quite apart from D-dimer, which we've had for four or five years now we can now do lots of other point of care blood tests"
 And the principle is really to try to give patients the best possible experience and to not overload secondary care with stuff we can do in the community
" And we recognize that as PCNs move forward and develop, there will probably be a move towards PCN level budgets for urgent care and secondary care"
" I mean, some areas of England have already got this"
" I mean, in east Kent is getting there in terms of activity, but they haven't got as far as costing it yet"
" But I can see the writing on the wall, you know that the the good PCN's will be rewarded with investment, that those that are lasting a fortune will probably get nothing more than whatever the baseline is"
" I see change coming with pcn being the unit of delivery in the community, but also becoming the unit of currency in the next few years"
"I think your general principles, you know, in areas where you're where you have an interest, obviously, to help with an education and pathway government is actually really helpful"
" I mean, I haven't mentioned that that, you know, there's there's 25 GPS in the western medical practice, which is the pcn before COVID"
" We had fortnightly clinical meetings, which we used for developing pathways, sometimes external speakers, sometimes internal speakers"
" And that was really appreciated not just by the GPS, but the nursing and paramedics that we employ, we also employ two pharmacists to one pharmacy assistant as well"
 So the idea of this becoming a rich learning environment
" Now, of course, we've become a community hub for Yeah, I can't remember in medical school"
 So the whole concept of being a learning organization is very much close to our heart
" So any help with that, from, you know, a company that has an interest in a drug that we will be using, you know, picks around being an obvious one"
" And then yes, that's very helpful"
 So that that that's in general terms
" I mean, within that, you know, the idea of cost modeling can be helpful, because, yes, the most obvious thing that the CCGs can monitor about PCN's, yeah, is drugs bed"
" There's the easiest thing to monitor really, yeah"
 And they are already monitoring that very closely
" And we get, we did get quarterly reports on how we were doing and how we're doing compared to our our neighbors, and Kent and a nation"
" So all of that side of things, I think will be monitored pretty closely as time goes on once the crisis of COVID"
" But, you know, because simply because it's so easy to monitor"
"We do yes, I mean, I suppose most people on anticoagulants of some sort"
" Are people with AF, that's probably the biggest cohort"
" Yeah, the DVT service is not just for our PCN, like any other UTC or virtually, anybody from anywhere can walk in"
" And we probably serve about population about 200,000"
" And in fact, for the DVT service, probably even further afield than that, yeah, our service is more accessible than the hospital based service"
" Yeah, and the time between decision to have an ultrasound and actually having an ultrasound is usually one or two days"
" In the hospital, it can be 10 days or more"
" And our colleagues, our GP colleagues that is around these kind of recognize this and they'd much rather get a patient diagnosed quickly and have them on low molecular weight heparin for 10 days or more, waiting to have an ultrasound to tell them they haven't got DVT anyway, which is yeah, it's not good for the patient, and it's actually a waste of money"
" So,"
"Okay, well, thank you for that"
" I mean, it gave me a thing, and it's really an open question is not not really a specific suggestion is that the certainly intent this this medical school is is a hot topic for us"
" Okay, never had a medical school"
" It's the largest accounting, not the medical school, okay"
 And it's a new venture for us
" Topic teaching the students, we've had medical students, junior doctors of every grade, paramedics, for years"
" And it's a this is a different way of training, because the training, the other grades I've just mentioned, it's whatever patient comes into the room, you talk about them"
" The concept of the medical school is completely different than if they are in the medical school doing a specific topic, you know, renal, cardiac, respiratory, they want their students taught the same thing in general practice at the same time"
" Now, that's an interesting challenge"
" And so getting together, any sort of help for medical students would certainly go down extremely well with the Dean of KMS"
 But it may well help these community community Learning hubs such as ours
 Yeah
 work in a slightly different way
" I haven't got a specific suggestion on that Tariq but its just a thought,"
"Okay, well, thanks"
 very brilliant
" No,"
and speaking to you Tariq
