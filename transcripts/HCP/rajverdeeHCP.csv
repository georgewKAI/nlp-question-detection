"Hey, how you doing"
"I'm fine, Raj, how are you"
Yeah
 Mohsin
 Yes
So I've probably not even been working as long as you have Raj
 So first thing
"I've been a pharmacist for eight years now, most of my time is spent in secondary care"
" And I've probably worked in every clinical area under the sun, really"
" But now I focus on high cost drugs commissioning, home care, and I'm the lead pharmacists for home care high cost drugs, meds optimization to kind of stuff, at the trust"
"Yeah, so I've done cardiology, I did my prescribing courses in cardiology, so no, no, no non valvular atrial fibrillation and speculation"
Yep
" So we we're tier three too, things, things are not great for two reasons"
" Number one, staff morale is down"
" We've got childcare issues, we've got people going off sick, some of them are severely sick, some of them have passed away"
 I think that emotional resilience is not there anymore
" And that's that's had an impact on on teams, and every department in the trust, those on the frontline, those who are supporting the frontline"
 So it's not been great in that sense
" Secondly, we're trying to maintain some kind of outpatient and elective activity"
" Whereas in the first time it wasn't the NHS, it was a COVID service, purely that we did nothing else in the first wave"
" So that's bought its own challenges as well, but no, we seem to be getting through it"
 Having said that
 some of the figures yesterday didn't look great
 We've had an increase of 50 in patients in with COVID since we've gone to tier three from the lockdown
"So yeah, see how that progresses"
"I do, but no one with my surname"
Although we are one big happy family so you know
"So, so I guess the first thing to say is I think I completely get what you're saying about the departments that you're working with"
" So it varies up and down the country, and it's led by individuals, there's no official rule as per se, it's just if somebody is open to work with pharma, or somebody is just completely anti pharma, because they don't want to be seen as- I mean, there's culture, you guys are the dark side"
You're the Daleks
 If you watch Doctor Who
"Yeah, it depends on each individual in terms of what we want to get from you guys is education"
" And that's, that's the, your bog standard ward pharmacists clinical, whether they specialize in cancer or HIV, whatever it is, that that's your role is education"
 So none of them are gonna be interested in the commercial side of things
 They just want to know information that's going to be useful for them and their patients
" So we have something that we do twice a week, or we used to before COVID came in"
" We used to have two two educational lunchtime sessions, where we'd give one of your colleagues a 20 minute slot to come and discuss their drug"
" If anyone was, you know, wanted more further information, they could take a conversation out of that 20 minute timeframe"
" So for example, if they wanted to set up a meeting with an MSL, you can always request that but actually, I'd say your bog standard pharmacists doesn't even know what MSL is"
" Yeah, yeah"
 They don't know
 They're just they're just all old pharma is just a rep trying to sell me a drug
 And that's the mindset that they have
" It's only when you go into more specialized therapies, and you really appreciate actually Oh, no, is it there's a bit more to it and each role is slightly different"
" You'd have a patient Access Manager, you'd have a just your bog standard hospital, you know, Access Manager"
"You know, somebody's doing the immunology, high cost drugs, market access"
" Yeah, entirely 11 MSL, it's just there's so many different roles"
" But I think bog standard, it's just education, you know, whether that's hosting a seminar, online during lunchtime, that might be interesting for somebody with VTE, cardiology, or whatever it is, or surgery, or, you know, having a seminar, or getting one of the pharmacists to present their perspective after work, and a couple hours"
So
" Sorry to interupt Raj, it's not your fault at all"
" It's something we're taught at university, it's simply, you know, it be taught, we're taught literally, it's no lie, we're taught the evidence they present to you will be skewed"
 So you don't listen to the evidence in the way they present to you
 You look at the evidence as the evidence
" Yeah, yeah"
 That's the conversation we have
" So you in terms of you selling the drug, you can't sell the drug to to us"
 Yeah
" What you can do it, you can present the evidence"
 And then our job as healthcare professionals is to critically appraise the evidence
" Unfortunately, some of them don't have to do that"
" Yeah, they don't know what to ask you"
 They don't like the questions they genuinely ask
 And that comes with experience
" But what I'd say is, you'd have certain types of pharmacists, within their roles, they are going to be the ones to engage with pharma"
" So if I was the chief pharmacist, I wouldn't want my band sixes, sevens, even some of my eights to be accessing pharma, because they know what to ask or talk about, it's just a waste of their time"
" But if you talk to one of my divisional leads, or one of my high cost drugs or formulary pharmacists, then you're going to have a meaningful conversation"
"And it's very common, it's actually happening already"
A lot of your competitors
" Yeah, definitely"
 Definitely happening
"No, nothing, nothing to really, really ask, I'll just say, my vision of working with pharma is around- it's complimentary, you know, you guys can support me in certain aspects, and I can support you in certain aspects"
" You know, it's nice not being a final decision maker, otherwise, I wouldn't be able to engage with pharma"
 But being able to give insights will only help develop that relationship
 And that's always been my kind of mindset going forward
"I don't want to make out like some kind of special individual or big headed etc, etc"
" But the way I think and I guess the insights are having to pharma into the commercial world, into the full kind of system-wide approach in the NHS, is quite rare"
" You won't get that, you will get that with your bog standard pharmacists"
" I've just never been interested in direct clinical care, I've been more interested in developing solutions to your problems on a system wide level, which is probably why I've more insights than your bog standard pharmacist at this age"
"Yeah, yeah, absolutely"
 I've set up sessions
" I've set up workshops, I've developed learning material, afternoon, all sorts of stuff"
" And yeah, I don't know where I find the time to be fair, my wife isn't always happy"
 Let's just say
"I've got a little boy, yeah"
"He's two years old, he's growing too fast"
 He started talking now
" And I just you know what, I just have to have come to that point in my life where I think I need to focus a bit more on him now"
When did it happen
Absolutely
Family first
 Family's always first
 That's always been the ethos
Are you
 Are you are you on LinkedIn
I'll find you
"You're not, you're not the head of Mercedes Benz in Slough, are you"
"Oh, yes"
"You're looking, you're looking slick in this picture"
"It's horrible, back pain is horrible"
Likewise
"Yeah, but I was told is half an hour"
If it helps to the previous lady ended it about 10 minutes before the end
" So I don't know might be right, who knows"
"Yeah, I think we just we just leave the call"
Absolutely
You too
"Wicked, thanks Raj"
 Have a nice day
Cheerio
 Bye bye
