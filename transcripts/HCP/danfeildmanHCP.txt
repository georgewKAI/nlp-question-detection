It's nice to Nice to meet you
Yeah nice to meet you too
 Right
"Alright, okay"
I guess
" I guess I've been around a long time, Dan"
"This is, this is all hair dye, Dan"
 I'm joking
 So and and you've been working for Pfizer for a long time
"And this will be the biggest change in your working practice ever, I suspect"
"I mean, I think to some extent, it has eased the ability to get in touch with people, but that's a bad thing is known as a good thing"
" Previously, you have control over my diary, and I'd say I'll meet you on Monday, in three weeks in Costa Coffee, and we'll have a coffee"
" And you it's much easier to get a relationship with somebody, if you meet them face to face and physically"
The day we know that relationships are what make things work
" Otherwise, Boris wouldn't be going to Brussels"
A telephone call just won't do
" And, and, and of course, it also disturbs it also disturbs the day more because you often say oh, you know, what is call me at 11"
 And then what happens is your day is completely disrupted
" whereas previously, I would not book any appointments in on a Tuesday"
 And this is not meant to be relevant to today's discussion
 But I would say I'm having Tuesday free and I would sit at home
 And I would have no cause
 I would have no meetings at all
" And, and so it's much in some ways, it's much more controllable, if everything is face to face, and it's much less controllable, because you need a guy, we'll just do a quick 15 minute meeting"
" But actually a 15 minute meeting takes 15 minutes beforehand, 15 minutes afterwards to be the whole hour"
" And it disrupts the concentration flow and in my job because I do half time research, um, having a full morning without disturbance is useful to get you in the zone if you like"
" Whereas I think, I think things are different"
" And of course, the other thing is that teaching meetings are very different aren't they"
 So teaching meetings are faster
" And yes, of course, the convenience is I no longer have to drive to Doncaster to talk to people about ECG's to give my Pfizer rep the opportunity to talk about something else"
" But um, but the GP's don't engage, they turn off their screen"
 And they're obviously sitting there watching something else
"And you're getting no questions, no engagement, no jokes work"
" So there are all of these things and and the end of the day, they don't use a tool for Statin because because because the data are strong"
" I think that is the case because it's not, they use it all the Statin because they had a really entertaining evening with a colleague who showed them some some interesting slides, some interesting data, but they usually remember one or two funny anecdotes rather than anything else"
 So this concept that you can show a bunch of Kaplan Meier curves over the internet and thereby expect people to use Atorvastatic over Simvastatin and is has yet to from my perspective to be to show results
"And it also it's also meeting other people, right"
" So the the participants can't interact with each other, which is, which is very difficult, they can interact with the speaker, if they're brave enough to put their hand up or to speak out and to interrupt, but they can't interact with each other, which I think is really something that you lose"
"And these, these, these participant interactions are often more powerful, because they'll say, oh, what do you think about what he's just said, and then the next time the guy next to him or the girl next terms that's really interesting, and that has a reinforcing effect on what I'm saying"
Absolutely
" And, and it's the discussion around it between the participants that actually leads to the solidifying of the educational process"
" So there are some, and these are things are lost from from from, from a Congress perspective, it's even worse, right"
" So most of my good ideas, and most of my collaborations have come from running into people in a restaurant after the meeting, or during the conference presentation, God forbid, I only ever go to restaurants after meetings"
 But you sit down and you talk about things
" And you think well, what do you think about this"
" What do you think about that reinforces the learning process, but it also then reinforces the development of new ideas"
" So yeah, absolutely"
 And I think this is a holding pattern
 But I think human beings will respond better to being face to face in due course
" I think we can kind of cope out we can kind of manage, but but to really move things along, we'll need face to face congresses again"
Yeah
" And, and it could be, yes, and it depends upon the customer depends upon the setting"
 It depends
" So for example, from the Congress perspective, if the customer or the client or the colleague or whatever is somebody who is listening, that's very different"
" But for somebody who's an active researcher, those are two different people"
" So most of my clinician colleagues, they go to a conference to get drunk and hear the latest data, but they're not designing or developing future research programs"
 Where as a small proportion of people that the Congress are actually there to develop future research and meet other researchers
" So I think there's, there's a difference there"
" And, and so, to some extent, from GPS, to where you're talking about VTE Prophylaxis, and we do need to talk about VTE Prophylaxis, I don't I don't, you must have a spiel that you need to run through"
"Okay, so what do you need to, what do you need to talk to me about"
"So it's, it's a really interesting question, and there are two answers"
" The first is, um I'm a GP or a jobbing clinician, how am I gonna identify a bunch of people with AF and there are lots of lots of technological ways, the vast majority, which would be completely irrelevant to the vast majority of patients with AF, they don't have an Apple Watch"
" They don't have a smartphone and if they do, they don't want to use it or can't use it"
" I mean, this, these technological fixes are never going to happen for the most people"
 When you and I are in that in that stage of life
"We are not going to be different to these old people now, right"
" So everybody thinks, oh yeah, the 20 or so, my fellows say I when I'm 80 I'll be completely ofay with smartphones, and I'll just use my Apple Watch to diagnose my atrial fibrillation and all organize to get some Apixaban sent to me, that is not gonna happen, right, because my father, who was a young stud aged 35, is now just an old fart"
" And, and, and so we change, therefore, we can't expect that things are going to be different in 20 years time"
" So we have to be prepared for the fact that the larger, larger proportion of AF is going to be picked up the same way as it is now"
" That's and and that's going to be by opportunistic pulse checks, palpitations, or exploring people with risk factors"
 Yeah
" So the researcher in me, says, obviously, the contrary, the researcher in me says that there will be technological fixes, these are probably not going to be smartwatches, smartphones, or any of that stuff"
" There is a there, there are numerous ways in which we can monitor people remotely, including tiny implantable devices that can do it"
 And Medtronic is working on two interesting projects in people who have risk factors for AF
" So we know AF doesn't occur in me, I don't have hypertension, I don't have diabetes, and I'm not fat"
" But But if you if you implant a tiny device into people with risk factors, 30% of them over three years will have AF"
 And that is not that is a big proportion of the people who would have been picked up opportunistically in you'll probably die earlier
"It's a study called the loop study running in Denmark and they implant- it's actually very sensibly done, they've been they've got a bunch of people with risk factors, half of whom have been employed, implanted with a loop recorder, and half of whom have not"
" And then those that are implanted a new per quarter, the physicians are invited to choose whether they want to anticoagulate based on the data or not"
" So obviously, the recorder picks up short bursts of AF, and there are then these people who say well, it's only a little bit of AF, let's watch a bit longer, by which time they've had a stroke"
" So, so there are some really interesting concepts there"
" And so the end point is not how much AF is there, the end point is strokes, which I think is really important, because previous work has always been criticized, well, it's just a little bit of AF, how much AF is AF"
" And, and, and so I think so one of the- go on"
"So one of the things that I think will change and and is changing is that companies will start working together, that would be my aim, or my dream would be that companies would come together with complimentary portfolios, and work together to sort some of these problems out"
" So Apple can make an Apple Watch, but at the end of the day, if you don't have something that will then first of all determine how much AF is relevant and B lead to an intervention, that doesn't require any other testing, the Apple Watch is useless"
 So you can't you can't use a technology to diagnose a condition but for finish the pathway there
" So what you need is companies to work together to say well, where's the pathway start"
 Where's the pathway end
 And what is the end point
 The end point is strokes
 AF is completely irrelevant
" You have no symptoms, by definition, otherwise, you'd have been to your GP with palpitations until you have a stroke"
 So so it is totally irrelevant that you diagnose AF
 What you need to do is you need to prevent strokes
" And if the Apple Watch doesn't prevent strokes, it's a waste of time"
" And so companies that make anticoagulation need to get wise and say how do we increase penetration, we increased penetration by getting a diagnosis and doing a pathway based study"
 Here we go
" There's the researcher in me, a pathway-based study of a test that leads to a patient oriented outcome, not not a diagnosis"
 And that's-
"Yeah, you're right"
 You're right
"Say, say that again, I think you just broke up there, just transiently"
"So I, up until a month ago, I ran the VTE program and the PE program for the trust that's now been taken over by a hematologist"
" We did not have a dramatic penetration of the new guidelines, the new long term VTE PE guidelines, because they kind of came out at the wrong time of year for us"
It wasn't a great time
" But but yeah, no so my communication with the primary care physicians, funnily enough, is usually through meetings, meetings, organized by colleagues in the pharmaceutical industry"
" And we talk about a host of things we rarely talk specifically about using Apixaban for AF, we usually talk about the concept of diagnosis, what is it"
 Why is it important
 And then we think about what we could do about it
" And it's really interesting, because I think unless you have pharmaceutically organized educational meetings, education rarely happens in any coordinated way"
 And because secondary care physicians just don't get out to see primary care physicians- we're working
" I mean, it's, it's mad but most of my colleagues work, you know, 12 sessions a week"
" So that's five days a week, and then one on call a week, or a weekend"
" So they, when are they going to see their primary care physicians"
" They only see their primary care physicians, when they say, you know what, I won't see my family Tonight, I'll go out and do a meeting about ECG's or Pfizer"
"Yes, it's true"
 It's true
 You're absolutely right
 So that is really the best way of doing it
 But who's to coordinate that
 Is it
 Is it the CCG
 Is it some private companies second secondary private company
 Or is it the pharmaceutical company direct
 I need to
It's really hard
" You know, the other thing that I think has has has changed is that there is this concept of protocols can replace education"
"That worries me slightly in that in that we don't need education we've got protocols, you just follow the protocol"
" And and and that has, is so pervasive now that when I do GP meetings, I barely see a GP I see mainly nurses, the GPS don't do education anymore"
" So we have disengaged a whole load of middle aged GPS who never ever, ever, ever engaged with education"
 And the nurses are there because they didn't get this education at medical school
So they have a completely different approach to things
 But both are now working to protocols
" In which it says, This is what you should do"
" It doesn't say why it doesn't give you any rich richness it just- and most people never click on the link for the primary data source, of course"
" There are some so there are there are some disadvantages to the way we now try to run our healthcare service based around protocols rather than helping people make the decision by giving them the information, rather than telling them, suggesting strongly that this would be the way they could go"
 But
"I mean, I think that I think that most most GP's and primary care nurses recognize that there is a pathway that starts with the diagnosis of AF, but but the you can't cease the pathway at the beginning"
 And and I think that companies usually assume that the diagnosis is being made effectively and efficiently
 And all they have to do is stand there and wait until the patient pitches up
 And then somebody will use that drug
 Well I think there needs to be potentially support education
 I don't know some sort of some sort of program around the the much earlier portions of the disease or the pathway
 So diagnosis
" And the best way of doing that is is to support some of these some of these initiatives in the community around, who's high risk"
 Who needs a check when
 How often do they need a check
 What should that check consist of
 And can we tie that check to a beneficial outcome in some logical non-made up way
More than some
"Yeah, I think they probably do"
" I think you have, but of course, there's always there's, there's always the cynical conflict, that you're making money off prescribe of prescribers"
" And I think that this cynicism is something that is very strong in, in all, all healthcare settings, it's just slightly more cynical, perhaps in the UK, because the companies are the enemy"
"And and it's about the commitment, and this is why personal relationships are really important"
" And this is why when people see you, and and and they get to know you they're, they start to realize that you are more than just a pusher of Apixaban, and more somebody who cares"
" Yeah, absolutely"
 And that is really easy to maintain over the internet
 But it's difficult to build over the internet
"So you, I know loads of people that I've met at conferences that I've kept in touch with through the pandemic, even though we haven't been seeing each other face to face"
 That's because I have a foundation on which to build
"Yeah, maybe maybe lower volume face to face or face to face with a couple of touch bases subsequently"
"But I think if they know that the team is not there just to sell but it's also to achieve outcomes for patients, that's really helpful"
It's because we're old
"Oh, really"
"Well, I know of him"
" I mean, I don't you know"
 There are 85 GP practices in Leeds
 So I know a fair bit of them
"Yeah, absolutely right"
 Absolutely right
Take care of yourself
Bye bye
