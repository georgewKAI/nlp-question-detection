Good morning
"Yes, absolutely"
"No, no, I've got an hour session now than an hour session at 1pm"
So we have kind of unofficially been trying to move towards an ICS model for some time
 And we've actually even given it a name
" So its Derbyshire together, which means our community, supposedly our community services, our secondary care, our CCG, or completely aligned and working towards the same objectives"
" Until the pot of money isn't one, you never truly going to be an ICS"
" But things have been speeding up over the last couple of months, I'd say"
" Even though we've got COVID going on, there's been quite a few official appointments for an ICS based model in the whole healthcare economy"
"I think it's gonna take, potentially take some autonomy and decision making away from us, and kind of amalgamate that power into a few individuals, which is concerning, but then I can see the efficiency side of it as well"
" So I'm talking more about formulary decisions, access to medicines, that kind of that kind of aspect of of life is gonna change for us"
"The second one, it's not going to be a case of communication, it's going to be a case of just seeing this made and your job is to just carry out"
"Again, it all depends on the leadership that you're working with, you know, you can say the same thing, or you can say it in two different ways"
" And you get a completely different result in terms of the, the attitude of the person receiving the information"
" So I don't think I'd be like judgmental now and be really cynical, although in my nature is cynical, to say you know, it's going to be all disaster"
 But it's difficult to motivate people to work on specific projects or make specific changes when they're not owning that decision
"but it's going to be those those few superior elite individuals who are handpicked are going to be part of that conversation, not those little soldiers"
 Yes
Gonna be people from our organization
" So I know, unofficially, people have already started being appointed to positions, you'll have the same it's gonna be the same people within secondary care, primary care, tertiary care, this is the same leaders who are going to be enacting this change"
 So yeah
just get new name badge
 So
"I think it's gonna take away some of that autonomous, some of that the hospitals traditionally have always had the power to do what they kind of thought was best for them"
 And I'd say the motivation behind that was either clinical evidence or money
 And we are PVR
" So we are paying for alot of our own drugs, and we make certain decisions"
" Over the last five years, I'd say that that kind of culture has changed to actually, we're still making the decisions, we're going to talk to you about it"
" And if you have any massive concerns, and fair enough, we'll have a conversation about it, I think that's gonna completely change, it's going to be a case of a decision is made centrally in this new joint formulary decision making body, you've got access to everyone, but not everyone"
" And then that decision making process becomes a bit polarized, because it's just a few individuals"
 And the genuine concerns of a specific organization are no longer going to be taken into account
" Now, I'm not saying that's going to be a negative thing"
" I think I think we have to be fair and give it a chance to work, but I can see the negative side of it, as well as the positive side of it"
"I don't have to say anything concrete, what I will say in secondary care, we are less driven by customer more driven by evidence"
" And in CCG, or PCG Call it whatever you like, they have always always been about acquisition cost, always, they don't have an appreciation for that patient"
 Because they don't see the patient
And it should I create should put because it's a few individuals who now retain the power
 I'm not convinced it's going to be as efficient as we want it to be
" So if you've got a chief pharmacist from a hospital, and then medicines, management at the CCG, sorry, they're not the best people to make the decisions"
They're just going to make posts on their leadership posts
 So it's going to be a clinical director is going to be an existing clinical director somewhere
" But in terms of a formulary application within the trust at the moment, you know, we'll have a clinical lead for that therapy area, and we'll have the specialist pharmacist and we've got a formulary pharmacist, we've got a CCG representative"
 So we've got a really localized approach to it
" You know, and yes, there is variation in care throughout the UK throughout different hospitals"
 But it's not the beauty of it
" The Commission wants to try something that he felt He believes in, they should have the right to do that"
"But not nationally, I'd say across the ICS Yeah, absolutely"
" It with an ICS we're gonna have Stoke hospital, we're gonna have Darby, just kind of from the same terms of formulary"
"The term postcode lottery has been thrown around a lot in conversations, and I think that's, that's a secondary, tertiary endpoint that they're trying to achieve"
Thats where all the money is
Absolutely
 Absolutely
 I think the second wave has been worse than the first wave
 And there's a couple of reasons for that
" Number one, staff morale motivation is down"
" Yeah, so workforce has been a massive issue, we've had massive spikes in the number of members of staff, either falling severely ill, or passing away or just not being able to come into work"
" Childcare issues have played a huge, huge, huge part of it as well"
" And there's been times when we've had no it ITU specialist from school, and you've had to pull over pull over the people and train them up as best as we could"
 For a short period of time
" We've changed the way we work a lot of instances, just to protect ourselves and protect our patients"
" And then on the other side of it, we've proven that in the first wave, we no longer were an NHS service, we were a COVID service"
 Yeah
" So all elective activity, outpatient activity was stopped to a bare minimum"
" This time, we've attempted to kind of maintain some level of of elective for outpatient activity"
" And that's been a real challenge, you know, for workforce for the patients"
" For our conditions, we've got this massive backlog, which is playing on our mind in the middle of winter pressures, although you could argue it's not as bad as it normally is"
" Yeah, it's not been great at all"
" And then you're hearing things on in the national press, or it's got nothing to do"
" Well, tell you, tell you now its not true"
"correct, yes"
I think I think the tier the whole tier system is a fallacy to be fair the tier system doesn't represent the true reality of working on the ground
 How can I reach in the size of a whole county be represented by a single number In a tier it just doesn't work
 no
" Think we're going to lose focus on his bed capacity it capacity, number of deaths"
" And that's the more kind of, again, in my opinion does that's what we're going to fix I'm not a tier given by somebody sitting in Whitehall"
" But I think throughout the country, every hospital will be feeling the same, because you know, they've got reduced capacity that you're having to work very, very differently"
" Because see the same note, just go into an outpatient or elective surgery clinic and you see the anguish of patients"
" My parents have been, I've been on a waiting list for over a year now"
" Oh, quite minor things"
 And it's had a massive impact on their lives alongside the fact that they're in lockdown
 So it's worrying from their perspective
"And so that's all we can hope to achieve, isn't it"
 It's just trying to keep your head open
" And if you're, if you're leading a team is trying to make sure everyone's okay"
" Yeah, and really kind of more than ever being a leader in this is so, so important"
" So, all you can one conversation in the morning with your team can change the whole day"
" Yeah, just noticing subtle changes in the behavior of people, their own stresses in their personal lives could be impacting them, I think we just really treat each other as humans, whether it's at work or at home or on the street, and have a bit more compassion"
 And I think that's the way forward
Absolutely Absoltely
Perfect
 That's great
Thank you You too
 Cheerio
 Bye
