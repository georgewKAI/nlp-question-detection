"Hi there, Dr"
 Ribchester So let me just click on this
" Okay, so I'm Jessica and work for Pfizer, sadly not on the vaccine side of things, but on the anticoagulation side, and I actually work in Oxfordshire"
" Yeah, so I don't know if you know anyone up there, but and what we're about what we're often about here, up here in Pfizer, and Oxfordshire is the sort of value that in healthcare systems that apixaban can bring"
 And it's the use of apixaban in particularly for your MVAF patients and helping prevent strokes
" I think it's my key role working for Pfizer, and that's what I like to think of my job as opposed to championing what what my drug might do or doesn't do, but looking at those aspects, which will will bring you value value to your whole system as opposed to the pcn and looking how to integrate what your needs are and how they can be delivered with the apixaban"
" When, during this time, I think it's been a difficult time, and I think it might have shown exactly how pcn probably can come work together and develop what's actually required in terms of a knock on effects that products bring and the services that they need to improve things like capacity and things what sort of challenges that you're finding"
Yes
" I mean, I could see when it comes to actually getting pots of money"
 It must be a bit of a
 Yes
 Yeah
 Ironic
 I think it is ironic
" It is ironic, I think, with my limited knowledge of PCN's and looking at how you can show prevention, ambulatory care, or personalized care, there are other pots of money where your demonstration of sharing that personalized care might trigger payments from other pots because I do know that PCN's can can gain gain from other areas with once, once those, once we've got COVID out of the way that that that showing that would that does that not sort of really further"
"Yes, yes"
"I mean, I think the overall, although I think I think with with Stroke Prevention that brings with it better, you know, you're not you're not doing secondary care and referrals"
 And you're you're not having that impact in the cost that way
 That sort of that that money saving idea of of your patients are cared for
" Because they're not getting their stroke, and then you're not having all those knock on effects that a stroke brings"
" But you're like you say that doesn't come in directly, you don't see Do you won't be able to value that that at all"
" I mean, that's that's difficult to put a price on a stroke prevention"
"So we've within Oxfordshire with they've looked at the apixaban news and over the last two years and looked at how many strokes they've prevented, as opposed to using warfarin"
" So it was it was a trial, a certain clinical paper done by one of the clinical pharmacists in the hospitals"
" And it showed instead of switch switching those patients from warfarin to apixaban, saved oxfrodshire CCG's 17 strokes"
" So yes, that that would be diluted out throughout the CCG as to which practice gains that but it's that, like you say it's that patient side of thing that you've got to keep bringing back to the forefront"
" Of course, that's the whole reason why you're you're doing your"
yes
 And it's that value that needs to be to be looked at
" But the but the, from my understanding, I mean, the challenges keep changing, and the immediate short term challenge"
" You know, what would a NOAC, thePerfect NOAC look like to you I mean, you do have a choice"
" And you say apixaban, you tend to tend to use it more often in your in your DBT clinics"
 And that but but are there times when you feel apixaban isn't appropriate or
Yes
" And with and with that, is that sort of a counseling thing where you can present it to them the option of NOAC's"
" What what what do patients say that they got dislike about a sort of, you know, twice a day"
 I think you're monitoring it
"Yeah, and you've got to be respectful of that"
" And this the persuasion of you know, this, there's less major bleeding and with the NOAC and"
"You know, they get to routine, isn't it"
"So, so looking at your the challenges with finding your new patients, how has that been in this particular time"
" Because they're not presenting, I suspect"
"And would would, because because that could be anticipated"
" Would there be a program say to look at patients with hypertension or obesity or diabetes to do maybe get other teams involved, like pharmacists, to to check the pulse of those patients"
" Well,"
"Yes, which then will have an impact on what you do your health prevention medicine that you're you're delivering for your population as a whole, then"
"And that brings me to the point where, you know, as other surgery what, you know, what are anticoagulation and prevention"
 Do you think there are some new steps you're gonna have to take to meet those challenges
"Yes, yes"
" And it's that I mean, as a, as a as a, with apixaban, you know, you've got that confidence to know that, you know, you are going to prevent more strokes, from your friend, you are going to have less major bleeding and warfarin"
" They don't need to take a substantial meal like they do with rivaroxaban, and they and you've got that 24 hours nice steady state of protection against stroke, particularly with their compliance lips"
 It's not long before they have to take their next one
" You've got those benefits, but but like you say it, it's it's trying to pre empt those challenges of how we can get those patients it sounds like is the PCN you're looking for the detection patient show the vulnerable ones more vulnerable than than the than the warfarin, the ones already on"
 NOAC 's
" So I think I suspect that, that that's going to be the way that medicine, medicine is going to go in the next year is that we've got to really, probably step up and, and concentrate on those detect patients"
"Yes, yes, or or pharmacies to have them as well"
 Then come in to pick up a script
 It sounds like you've got the detection
 Really well under way and and within within the within the PCM how the rest of your GPS following  anticoagulation
" Within oxygen what tends to happen is, is there are a few experts within a within a pcn or surgery who can read CCG's better than others or again to is that the same within the"
"Yes, but I mean, that sounds a fantastic setup"
 I'm definitely not happening that I know of happening here in Oxfordshire
" Sounds, yeah, that it takes having those experts leading in the in the therapy areas"
" And, and, and her challenge must be, you're seeing patients Now then, and what the limits you can do over over well,"
"Yeah, yeah"
 That's something that secondary care can get involved
 It's meeting both in the middle then isn't it
" And and, like you say, if, thankfully, if on Pfizer, you know, if both bought into the same product, which then brings the whole simplicity to anticoagulation"
" It brings that scenario where you know exactly what the drug is going to do, what's going to interact with what what what results you should be getting from it"
" Which, which is why it's use in oxfordshire so that there's no what what what do you do with this drug now, you know, it's a different one than the last the previous patient"
"I think when you've got PCs, That can meet the secondary care in the middle, it's bringing really good care,"
Mm hmm
" Okay, so what what would you need to know from me about the NOAC's or apixaban in particular that would that you don't know already, then"
 You're
That's the impression I'm getting that you You're definitely upsc you're up skilled and knowledgeable
" And everybody is in that position where you, you know, you know, you know exactly what's going to happen, what's required and what you need from it from a NOAC I can and choosing, is fitted, fitted in with that,"
Yes
" And the Do you know what your your percentages sort of use of the lower dose in, you know, your elderly patients moving on to the lower dose those patients will"
"Okay, that was all really, I was just going to, I mean, it's, it sounds like if if I worked up in your area, it would be providing all the patient resources for those who are here for the nurse and that sort of thing and checking that they've got everything they needed, or a apixaban patient in that area"
 And that sort of those ongoing educational pieces that we can bring to support support
 Its used rarely
 And
"Hmm, yeah"
 Great
 Okay
"Well, thank your time, it's been incredibly interesting"
" And I will be, I'll be using your example of your surgery to the surgery we have in in Chipping Norton, we're very keen to develop a system like yours, I think working with secondary care, and they already have an cardiovascular outreach program where other GPS can referring to it"
" But I think they definitely want to go towards towards your, your,"
Yeah
" very fulfilling, I'm sure"
" Okay, great"
"Bye,"
