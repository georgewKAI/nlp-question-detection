Hiya
"Yeah, that's fine"
" Yeah, no worries"
Yeah
 Okay
 Do you have any idea of what kind of things a pharmacist in primary care would be doing at the moment
" Just to get an idea of- I don't want to tell teach you to suck eggs ior anything, so"
"What you know, okay"
" So what actually the what, what you've described is what I do, I'm not actually a PCN pharmacist, I am a practice based clinical pharmacist"
" And, and have been for a very long time"
" And so I've been around for quite a while and was prob, I think I probably know who you're referring to in terms of being partners, as well, and was involved in a lot of the big shift in towards getting pharmacists into GP practice from from the beginning"
"So yeah, what you've described is quite similar to what what the kind of role that I have, and I was initially bought in to help basically free up GP practices,GP's"
" And, and take over a lot of the chronic disease management roles, sort of the titrating blood pressures and, and discussions after annual reviews about the statins and risks and things like that"
 And it that has developed over the years to much more varied roles
" So a clinic for me could be doing blood pressures for one patient could be doing respiratory for the next could be doing depression, then pain, then all kinds of different things, it can be all kinds of different"
 In addition to that we have like the hospital medication reconciliation work and things that are going on in the background
" So in terms of my actual role, and I have a team of five, there's five of us"
 And so I have a technician and a medicines manager who are employed by the practice
 And who deal with a lot of the medicines reconciliation work and sort of the a lot of the prescription process type things not in terms of the actual repeat prescribing because we we're a massive practice
" So you know, that that's another team altogether"
" Separate to that, and but in terms of and, you know, things like start and end of month drugs and, and prescription queries and medibox queries, all this kind of thing"
" We've, you know, we've got a lot of that going on"
" In addition to that, and we have two PCN pharmacists"
"And so a one's been with me for 12 months, and one's been with me for about eight weeks"
 And so they're developing into their process
" So, the practice base pharmacists that you know, and that you you've been talking to, they're similar to me"
 They've been in their position for a really long time
 They know their stuff
" They're quite, they're quite sort of established they- and respected and they they know what's going on with a PCN pharmacist it's grown on from the original NHS pilot to that was rolled out"
 It's a developmental role
" So you know, you've got that 18 month program that you're going through"
" So you can have somebody like my second pharmacist who's come in eight weeks, and she's at the start of her journey"
"She's just starting to understand primary care how it all works, what happens, try and find her feet"
" And then you've got my my first one who is a year in, she's much more established, now she's managed, she can manage a patient cohort quite happily byherself"
" But yeah, and established all those relationships"
" And it can be quite tough in the beginning part because a lot of a lot of PCN PCN pharmacists won't have another pharmacist in the practice, and or the practice may not be used to have in somebody, they'll be used to the CCG commission as pharmacists, that team of pharmacists coming in deliver in the switches and things like that, but they'll be there for a couple of hours a week, maybe, they'll be used to that, to that, you know, the pharmacy police that we get called"
" And, you know, they'll be used to that bit and, and doing that, but having somebody who is developing into a position as peer alongside them, that can take some time to develop that relationship and for the expectations of the GP, as well, in terms of what they want, that can be a bit of a shock to some people, we found that when we're developing things"
" And so, yeah, and then what we do varies from place to place, even within one pcn it will vary"
They're part of my my team
" So, so that so even though, you know, the way our PCN is set up, they are employed via the trust, rather than via the practice"
" And so for that, for them, it is quite, it's almost like they've got two masters"
" They've got their employer the trust, but then they've got us, the practice, but they are part of my team"
" And unfortunately, the way it sort of set up the you know, that it's set up to bring more pharmacists into primary care, so they're not expecting there to be another pharmacist, or they're in place to help guide them and things like that"
" So it does get a little bit awkward around that, because I am really their supervisor and looking at what they're doing"
" But I can't be that on paper, it still has to be aGP"
" So kind of I basically, I do a lot of it"
 And the GP sort of plays in as well with it
" But yeah, we still have quite a lot of things going on"
" And so, you know, we've got quite if they are part of my, my team, and we all work around together"
" We work around the same and although I'm aware of their days, and I know what's on that and what they have to deliver in terms of that"
 We're working as a practice to make sure that that is actually that they're actually working as part of the practice process
 Not not as a separate entity
So that we're we're actually bringing in to the whole process together
 And so we devloped it there
No
" Straight to 3,000 patients"
No
They're solely mine
 And all the other practices have a have a PCN pharmacist
We did initially last year
" So my first pharmacist, she was one of two"
" Yeah, so we already had an NHS England clinical pharmacist who migrated into the PCN role and then recruited a second and they split the seven practices up among themselves"
 And but the pcn took the decision to get more
" So, and we actually have eight PCN pharmacists um for the seven practices because we are by far the largest"
"it has that we've, you know, we've made few changes, you know, things and you know, things from my point of view is, is actually going right, hang on a minute, I've got to free up a bit of time to be able to support these people and to develop the team and to be able to do that"
And it's almost impossible to do that and still do a full load of clinical work
" And so you know and even my role has changed over the past few years, you know, I've, over the years, I've, I've sort of developed different bits and pieces and become involved with the practice on a much more strategic levels, so I'll be involved in in how the flu vaccine program is ran and, and developed n training, and in supporting system change in the practice"
" And, you know, lots of different things"
" So sort of coming to terms really with late I've, yes, I still have patient contact, but actually, maybe that needs to be a little bit less at the minute so that I can develop and support other people and support the practice more efficiently and not burn out"
"Yeah, because I think it really come came to, to light really how much actually I was involved with till I sat down with one of the partners and just sort of we did a bit of a brain dump"
" And it was like oh, yeah"
" So I've got this, this and this, and I want to do this and this and this"
" And I've got this and this and this, and this"
 And there was just issues like writing and it was pages and pages
" And it was like, Oh, my God"
" Oh, yeah so I need a bit of time to do that"
Yeah
"Very, where I work is very deprived"
 So there's a lot of digital poverty
" And so whilst patients may have mobile phones, they may not have data, they may not have credit"
" And so we've were a lot of our stuff is, is over the phone now rather than face to face"
" And there's a lot of things that and, you know, normally I wouldn't book somebody in with, say, HCA to do a blood pressure, and then I'll ring and follow it up, because I could, I could do all of that within an appointment"
 But they it's very much they've wanted to try and keep us out of the patient face to face
 So it's very much telephone
 We're using a lot more and remote technology so using things to send texts for online reviews for chronic disease
 So that they can do things that way
 There's lots of different options with that
 Send in text for video videos on inhaler technique
" And so you know, different bits and pieces like that"
 So how we've practiced has changed and changed quite a little bit
 And I think some of that will stay
 And I think there's definitely been a bit of women- I do miss the in-patients and for a lot of patients it is a lot easier in inhaler technique virtually is
"It's not, you're trying to get them to describe what it is that they're doing or send them the video"
" Not entirely sure if they're watching the video, what's what's happening"
" It doesn't really substitute for going right, show me how you use it"
 And let's correct it
 But no way in hell do I want somebody doing that in front of me right now
 So
"So you know, things like that I'll miss"
" And but in terms of doing more sort of telephone follow up on things and doing things that way, I think a lot of that will stay"
 And a lot of this sort of remote online reviews will stay
 As well
" But even that takes, you know, different"
 You're starting to learn different skill sets
"In terms of doing that drawing out the questions and things because you're not getting the physical feedback, but also sort of having a bit more resilience as well"
 One of the things that has really struck me is it is it can be so much more draining on the phone
"And because, you know, I was saying to one of my doctors, I was like when I had a morning clinic, I knew I was working from half past eight through till quarter to one"
" I had 10 minute appointments, I had break and catch up slots"
" But you know, you knew what you were doing you were going through, your saw the patient were there, you had that slot, and you were going on and that was it"
" If they turned up, they turned up if they didn't turn up, then yeah, you know, you you smi- moved on, and you did things like that"
" Whereas with telephone, it's like, it's almost like a never ending list sometimes"
" And if they don't answer, then you've got to try again"
" And it's like you're chasing, chasing your tail, almost and you can end up still be trying to do the same number of consultations"
 But it's dragging on in two to three o'clock in the afternoon
 Because you can't you can't get hold
"And then the patient, also the patient, there's no visual clues for like, this is the end of the console"
"And so it can be very difficult, because it'll be like, well, I've got you on the phone"
" So I want to do this, this this and this"
" And you go, no, hang no, hang on"
 Let's do it
" Let's do this first priority bit, and then we'll see what we can do about that"
" And move things on, or, you know, the impact that COVID and lockdown has had on our patients, a lot of them are very isolated and vulnerable and having somebody on the phone"
" Like, them, somebody to have some somebody new to speak to, you know, and you can't just go right bye leaving, you're just like"
" Yeah, give them five minutes of your time just to do something"
" But if everybody if all 15 do that, that's"
That's a lot of time that's going on
"Yeah, I think that's that's been a sort of quite a big thing is sort of various meetings and things I've either been involved in or have signed into"
" There's something to be said sometimes, because you're not always sure, when you go into it"
" You might see the agenda and things like that, but you're not always sure, am I going to learn something from this"
 Is it pitched
 Where's that pitched at
" And, so you'll find this with the you've got your established practice base pharmacists that are working at quite a high level and got your PCN that are developing"
" And so finding some sometimes you go to a meeting and you find it's pitched at a PCN pharmacist, like a developing pharmacist, and you're going, brilliant that was, you know, two hours out of my that I can't say- maybe I've learned one thing which is still valuable, but was it worth two hours of doing that"
 And could I have got that some of the way
" Whereas when you do when you sign in into something remote, you sort of say, this sounds awful, but it's not how I mean it, you can, you can have it running in the background while you're doing something else"
" You know, even if it's something as mundane as doing the ironing, or doing something like that it's running in the background, you're paying attention, you're paying some attention to it"
" And then you're like, oh, that's interesting, actually, I'll put this down, and I'm gonna pay more attention to this"
" Or, you know, that's been, that's been really quite a useful thing"
What levels it yeah
"Whereabouts it's pitch to that's something that I've always found quite difficult, as we go as we go along"
" And, you know, we have education as pharmacists from CPPE the College of Postgraduate Pharmacy Education, though, no, you know, nothing against them that they traditionally been based"
" It's either been community pharmacy, or hospital"
" Never really, you've always struggled with with the middle, like the middle like, well, I'm neither of those"
 So where where do I fit
" And, and that has it developed, I do have a GP pathway as well"
" But again, it's focused towards your developmental pharmacists and doing things like that"
" And, and whilst there's some benefit in it, and there's some things that they do provide that are really good, you're then stuck again, going, well, that's not quite the level I want to go to"
" And then you might go to a GP meeting and go, where are her hang on a minute"
" And I mean, sometimes it isn't, sometimes the GP meetings are exactly the level that you actually want"
" And particularly if that's your an area you're working in, and you're working at the same level as a GP, if you know if it is regarding prescribing and guidelines and things like that, but when it sometimes when it gets into So you're going to do this investigation and examination, and you're like no I'm not"
" No, I don't touch the patients,"
"Thank you, cheers"
 Bye
