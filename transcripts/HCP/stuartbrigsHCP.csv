"I'm doing alright right sorry, I just come out of one meeting and I went downstairs for roadway"
 And that's why I'm late
 I forgot that we have back to back meetings today
 Not with you guys
 But obviously my other work goes on in the background
" So, yes, what do we need to talk about Stuart"
You dont look old enough
You must have started straight out of school
That's exciting
 Were you for five were you Pfizer or were you Parke Davis
"Oh, there you go"
Umm kind of
Yes
 So I'm a heart failure doctor
" And, and, and I do just, I'm a heart failure doctor"
" So I do pacemakers, and I do"
" So that's, that's kind of how I better but at the time, when atorvastatin launched, I was just a first year registrar and cardiology"
" And then it was, it was an entertaining time, because at the time you launch 10 milligrams of atorvastatin"
" everybody's like, Oh, my God, what's it gonna do"
" And um, And I wrote to the GP's, and they say, well, but the cholesterol, I've got to check the cholesterol"
" I said, No, no, no"
 Just give it to everyone
" And, and then, and, and so I said, anybody who's at a heart attack, anybody who's had angina, anybody's had a stroke just given to 10 milligrams of atorvastatin fire and forget was my standard email and everybody thought I was a nut"
" Now, if you look at what we're doing, we give everybody 18 milligrams of atorvastatin"
" And if you go back to 98 99, youd think to yourself Wow, they wouldn't even of dreamt of the timd, they dont even test cholesterols now"
"No, because I was living in"
"So I Well, first of all, when, when Parke Davis came around came around"
" I first of all, was working in South Wales"
 I was looking Newport
 I don't know
 I don't know who who was the Parke Davis rep in Newport
" But they took me to the very first my very first ESC was Parke Davis stroke, Pfizer in Vienna"
" And I spent a lot of time walking around, I did the very junior registrar thing, which is, I have no idea what's going on"
" So I'm going to go to every evening meal that has been organized, and they organize a tour of Vienna, which was awfully nice of them"
" And I met loads of people that that that week, and and then on my way back from from the flight, in, which was into Heathrow, because there were I mean, it was 1998"
 Right
 So it wasn't like I had to fly to Heathrow
 And I met john cleeland on the flight home
" Who said are Klaus, I've got a I got to review some abstracts"
 He sat on the opposite opposite side of the aisle to me
" He said, well have a look at these abstracts for next years USC see if they're any good"
" And then and they said, oh, by the way, I've got a job going in Hull and in in 12 months time in September 1999"
 And this was obviously September 98
 And that was how I then ended up moving to Hull
 And the Parke Davis guy in Hull
 I can't even remember Paul was his name
" very senior guy, regional manager for Parke Davis in Hull"
" And in early 2000, just when Parke Davis was starting to be swallowed, Paul and his team moved over and we went on the most amazing ACC conference in Los Angeles"
 And when we went we did some stuff that you don't want to know about
 We went to
We went to Universal Studios
" I think it's possible that Paul Paul, through Pfizer even pay for the entry"
" And which is a very different world nowadays, of course, it was there was no educational value to that trip at all"
" But it was, but it was really good because, and I've talked with this with with Dan about this, and one of the things that we, we've talked that you can kind of do a holding pattern, for relationships between representatives, pharmaceutical industry, and physicians and nurses, you can tell it to a holding pattern, it's very difficult to build relationships over the internet, you can you can work with people you already know, it's quite difficult to start up a new relationship with physically face to face with them"
 And I think that's a challenge going forward for the pharmaceutical industry
" Because you will, increasingly are increasingly at risk of being these guys to come in and want to just sell stuff"
" Whereas before it was a relationship, and you built a relationship around several humans wanting to do the best for other humans"
" And yes, yeah"
" And and now the risk is, is with our cold, unfeeling, non touchy world where we're all in different parts of the world"
" I mean, you could be in, you could be in Timbuktu, no idea where you are"
" And you it's entirely possible, you don't give a toss about me, what you care about is just the bottom line, and you're going to sell more atorvastatin or whatever"
" Yeah, I think that is something that is a challenge going forward"
 How do you build a relationship with people over the internet
"yes, you're right there are there"
" I mean, if we had tried to do what we do, did give, even 5 or 10 years ago now, we'd be completely stuffed"
 So there are there are possibilities
" Now that wouldn't have existed when you and I first started doing this job, but it's still not I dont think, I don't think it will completely replace face to face meetings"
"Quinapril god, yeah, we used to have these use"
 Quinapril broke quite a bit
" It has some advantages, but didn't last"
"I have so soon, I have tried to avoid it"
" It's so rare and so vastly expensive that the, for me the population, I'm kind of a population epidemiology pathway kind of guy"
 Yes
 The the best way of doing stuff that is of no use to the population as a whole
 So I have I have to say that your colleagues have tried to engage me in this whole conversation have been slightly reluctant at the current price for the current outcomes
 It's been a difficult task for them
"Yes, and I think it's important in this field, particularly because it's such a personalized part of part of the job that your, your contact with physicians has to be even more of a partnership based arrangement than for example, I want you to use a eplereonone, which is now relatively cheap and should be used in almost everyone"
 And it's a very different approach
" And so your, your approach to physicians has to be almost even more personalized to your particular field is going to be even harder to do online than somebody selling apixaban for example"
"Yeah, and that's it, that's one of the challenges for these one to one meetings is that you're not allowed to come into the hospital anymore, and just get the odd cup of coffee"
" And then three people sit down together, you can reach the whole team at once, or you can arrange to meet the whole team at once"
" And you can form a partnership with, with with with a whole range of the pathway, that's guessing"
"So on a lot a normal a lot of the work we do now is on the telephone, which is quite wrong, because it's quite hard to know what their pulses, you can't increase the load, you can't increase the beta blocker until you know what their pulse is"
 So that's a challenge
 And but it can be done
 It's just we've been slightly resistant to it
" And actually, our patients don't quite like seeing us they are scared of COVID because that's what they want us to be they want us to be scared otherwise we'd all be out partying and buying beer"
" So to some extent, of course, the fear, is part of the strategy to control the virus"
" So the patients are all very scared, and which is limited our research capacity because we can't do clinical research on them without seeing them that really is difficult"
" Yes, you can see the medical management, it can be done"
 It's just the volume is much lower because people are presenting with heart failure they're presenting with they're not coming to hospital as they are we're just waiting to see see how so the the diagnosis has gone down
" And but those that do get diagnosed, we can actually do reasonably okay"
" I remember you know, it's interesting that you were you were a eplerenone"
" I remember when many many, many years ago, the ephassis study was launched and I was a research fellow in Hull and we we did ephassis in Hull and, I went to the investigators meeting"
" And then we completed the study and then I went to the launch meeting with Pfizer as it was then yes, and and I possess so the whole so a epleronone is really the study the drug that I kind of watched, come through from dinner, sometimes ridiculous idea to eventually being being approved"
" And then we did a we did it, we did a HTA health economic analysis on it"
 And that was the first my my my first foray into health economic analysis
" So I do have some relationship with a Eplerenone as well, which is kind of funny"
"Yeah, absolutely"
" I mean, I in fact, it may be it may in fact, be the when you were about to release your, your blue pill that that I bought a I think I bought for Pfizer shares at that time, and then it got split and split and split again there was all I could afford at the time"
" And, and now I have 65 shares, which is not very many, but they have grown and"
" So so I think So I have a close relationship with Pfizer, I used to keep a close eye on everything that came out of manufacturing and out of the product line in, in North America"
 And I've always been very enthused by the richness of the scene that Pfizer have had and apixaban is only one of those things and you're here
 Your amyloid treatment is of course another since it's really pleasant to see
" And now of course, the COVID vaccine, very manufactured in developed and manufactured in Germany"
 So it's all good
really exciting times
Time flies by so i think so it's really good
 This is a really interesting project because I think it'll really serve to identify what can and what can't be done over the internet and it would be really nice
" And, and your work"
 You're working on it
 You're still you're in the Midlands you said
"Wow, I've never been to Grantham them but I've been through it on numerous occasions on the train"
isn't the you know when you're getting near home because it's Grantham Grantham is on the way home
 When you've had a terrible fight to get on the train at kings cross you get to Grantham and starts quieting down a bit
 Burbidge
 You used to have to do a lot of driving then before
All right
" Well, I hope you have a I have to have an entertaining day"
 Do you have any more meetings today
" I guess, I guess there's some Pfizer thing going on in the background that you're gonna have to log back into"
Take care
 Bye bye bye
