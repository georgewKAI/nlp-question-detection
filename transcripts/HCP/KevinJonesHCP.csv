how are you
I'm very good with the WebEx has just put a box up with this removed
 So yes
" Hi, I hope you can see me now"
Yep
 Perfect
Yeah
" So, as Tracy just alluded to you, this is your third conversation"
" No in the background of all, all of the people that you're going to be speaking with, I think they're all have been VTE"
" And quite frankly, I think there's probably quite a part from what you do"
 Am I right in thinking that's correct
"So yeah, it's, it's relevant to what I do"
 I've yeah
In in relevant in how does that relate to what you do
"So, as a pharmacist, VTE is a big part of our work, isn't it from anything all the way from anyone who's admitted to the VTE assessment and then make sure you have perplexus"
" And then, yeah, thereafter"
Right
 Okay
" Because Because my, before we spoke, I did a little bit of research around homecare pharmacy and assumed that actually, that's where you're from"
 Isn't that
 Is that still correct
 Yeah
So I have a very broad portfolio
 Yes
" I may homecare, hyper strokes and formulary pharmacists"
 Yeah
 And I guess the commissioning of formulary part of me means I have to be involved with everything
" guidelines, all the new additions to the formulary to new pathways"
" But in a previous life, in a more junior life, of course, you know, day to day work was just purely clinical on the wards for the patients"
Yeah
" And so at the moment, so were you working from home care, you're looking at NICE TA's, specifically"
" If you've got a guideline update, then such as the most recent one for VTE, and recommendations within that for DOACs How does that from an internal process, become do become part of that discussion"
"So fall into the medical director of pharmacists role, I have no written terms of the budget impact analysis, getting things into the formulary, if I know the contacts better than the Directorate for medicine, that I've engaged with those conditions"
 So it's more of a supportive role for the director of pharmacist
" And then I would be involved in disseminating that policy or guideline update to clinicians in my portfolio, and then also engaging the conditions to see if they want to have any input in terms of their primary care stuff"
Yeah
 Interesting
" And so one of the things from this new guideline, big for the reason that VTE one was was health economic comments that lead to recommendations within it"
" Your, in the pharmacy director, how does that then translate to"
 Do we make a decision
 Are we going to change what we currently do based on these recommendations
"To be fair, in terms of the the financial aspect of it, slightly complex in the sense that we don't really care in the hospital to be quite honest, but then we have to engage our CCG in primary care clinics, because then essentially, they're the ones continuing things, or they might kick the burden on for a reason"
" So the economic side of it didn't really have much of say, there's more clinicians driving it from their experience, or whatever was"
"it for in this example, it wasn't necessarily acquisition"
" Or, you know, tariffs price, it was all it was very much focused on outcome"
" So if if, you know, when they looked at the, I guess, the medicines optimization, it was around, is there an advantage of one or the other in terms of reduction in risk and bleed"
" And yes, you know, from your perspective, if you've got patients who are taking treatments, that there are risks complete by the way in which they're aministered, then I guess that becomes a little bit more relevant in terms of what the outcomes are correct"
So the whole umbrella of what we call analysis of clinical effectiveness
"So there was some doacs Noax's, whatever you want to call them, that were priced extremely empathic"
 They were one of the polar sides of things
" So you know, did see it in those cases is quite easy"
" But when the pricing is so similar, then it comes down to preference lessons"
Yeah
" And Does the guidelines influence when it comes down to preference because I think one of the things that NICE say was that we look to sequentially like a sequential pricing to see whether or not there was any, I guess, not error and calculation but whether or not that would change"
 What happens in terms of recommendation
 And what they said was no clinical data was the clinical data
" This is what we're basing it on, irrespective of, you know, whether there will be a reduction in price or considerations in price difference"
" Again, if you're not looking at properties, and you're looking at value, what does this mean to us in terms of our impact of prescribing One doac over another"
 thats the important bit
Sorry I kind of lost you halfway through
 What was the question sorry
Sorry
" So the question is, if you look at so its price, so when you get a guideline, it's not talking about price, but he's talking about outcome"
"Yes correct,"
"then, rather than being one preferred over another, do you have to look at the data that NICE have presented to say, actually, are we working in line with nice, or is there a reason why we're not"
I kind of see what you're trying to get at
 I say is the way we work in the hospital now is we take what NICE says as biblical
 Yeah
" So when I says we will go with in terms of the commercial side of things with the pricing, from my experience, I found that the clinicians aren't really interested"
" interested, you might get the associate director who's kind of that involves that ha work, but the most important interest, so it gets the pharmaceutical will bring that aspect into an indented conversation where appropriate for the conditions will dictate using their experience, and I find their real life experience and preferences always seem to trump the data"
 Yeah
" Because the data realistically, does it"
 There's no real head to head analysis of that
" No, there isn't"
" And there never will be, it's telling me they continue, they never will be"
" So yeah, the data is taken a pinch of salt"
" But what I found with the doacs and noaxs, the cardiologists whoever is working on it, or the hematologists, they have a preference, they just have a preference for for whatever reason, it's from their real life experience"
"Yeah, no, I agree"
" And I think that, you know, my conversation is that it's the case is quite illuminating"
" Sometimes when you do get real life, you know, some experience that they've had, you know, added to the discussion"
" Because from your perspective, you work quite closely with the patient, is that or assume you work quite closely with patients"
" Because on so many, you know, that you get feedback from patients about how their medicines are working for them"
"To know me personally no, I'm very, very far from direct patient contact nowadays"
" which is unfortunate, or is it"
" I don't know, depends"
 I see it with COVID going around
" So to be fair, it's not been on the top of my agenda, and I've not really probably looked at for a long time"
"No, no, I appreciate you"
"Again, sorry"
 I don't have any insights in terms of what patients are feeling
"Yeah, yeah"
" No, and I wasn't expecting that"
" But my understanding, I think it's just that when I looked at some of the role, you know, description, what you do on a day to day basis, from health care, home care, refinishing, it was sometimes actually looking for feedback from patients about, you know, how their medicines are"
 So you are now removed from that what you're saying
" Yeah, completely"
Yeah
 From the patients who are having bt doacs
" Yeah, I wouldn't only see them"
I wouldn't even prescriptions
 It's just very far from what I do now
"No, sorry"
 I'm saying that
 From a homecare lead perspective
 Yeah
 From a BTE perspective
 Yeah
 That was a comment around where the patient contact may
"So in terms of the patients who use the homecare services I commission, we have regular contact with them"
" So yeah, but it's normally when when things go wrong, but we do have a twice yearly survey where we get their opinions and how things work and what we can improve on etc etc as well, so"
Yeah
 And have you started seeing these any introduce new kind of technologies or results or are looking to use new technology resulted in a way in which you can get feedback from patients as well
Absolutely
" So we have two new platforms, which we just introduced into UHTV"
" And there one is obviously the video conferencing tools, which allows us to engage patients in a much easier way"
" But there's a second one, which is quite interesting, where the patients are able to, number one access all of their data letters, etc"
 But also they're able to communicate directly with a consultant as well
Okay
So that kind of conversation is ongoing
 It works better with younger patients
 Absolutely
 It is it is quite effective
" And, and I've seen that work with now rheumatology and dermatology departments"
Right
 Okay
 And I understand that there's some new technology available that allows patients to give almost instant feedback
" Whether it be it's a patient reported outcome measures is that the same thing, you know, if you've got is that there are apps that have been developed, where you can get feedback from patients, you know, you so you speak to them on a daily basis"
" But if you get a quick response from patients about how their medicines are going, is that something that you considered as well, during this period of time or"
Not really
 Not really
" I feel like the whole app, this whole hub of conversation seems to be on the agenda for our colleagues and farmer"
" But unless that app is meeting a need that isn't met, there's, there's no, there's no real benefit to it"
" And a lot of these patients, so you know, look at the high cost drugs area, rheumatology biologics, for example"
" They need support, if they are biologically first time to introduce the treatment"
" We have psps for that, which kind of meet that need"
" But the patients who are in on a second or third non biological ready, they, they don't need much support, and they know the mechanisms that they need to pursue, to and know when to escalate, if they need help, and that's the kind of model that we've introduced"
Pharma companies seem to be going down one route and want to engage with you in one way
 How was it
" How do you all how would you prefer to be, you know, to engage with pharma"
" Is there, is there something that you think to get from them, you know, from physicians or"
"So, I think the way I do I engage one or my department engages pharma is quite effective"
" We speak when we have a purpose of speaking, rather than just having pleasant conversations if that makes sense"
 Because things are things are very busy all the time
" Obviously, I build a rapport with the people I work with, they know how I work, I know how they work"
" For example, there's a nice new nice technology appraisal, I don't really want to speak to you before the appraisal has been approved"
 And because there's not much value to be added there
" But I do appreciate the fact that you're bringing it to my attention, and then no, leave it with me, I look into it"
 I like the fact that it's all virtual now
" So you know, I'd have to wait for meetings, there's no traffic, there's no car parking issues"
" I'm going up at all, but I've got a meeting I log on there, we have a conversation, off you go"
 In terms of what I like to get from my colleagues in pharma is around education
" So I like it when the MSL's come in, or they host a seminar with some experts who are can maybe get some of my junior pharmacists involved listen or present"
" And I think, you know, pharma, supporting NHS colleagues to teach without NHS colleagues is something that's really picked up recently"
 And it's really valuable
So one of the things that I've noticed differ for me when I've tried to contact health care professionals about meetings that have been on and date
" So it's almost like how would it help you go through, you know, you'll get a lot of requests to join"
" And not necessarily at the time that you want it, you know, it's kind of like, another request that's come through and other requests has come through"
" I mean, how are you then filtering what you want to know from"
" You know, in terms of the expectational access you want"
It's two things
" So, number one is priorities"
" So I love my own set of priorities, only engaging the ones that I find that are gonna add value to me"
 And number two is interest personal interests
" If I've got an interest or you know, I admire a consultant in Leeds, who swings between experts references, of course, I'm gonna log in, because I make time for that because it's part of my learning, isn't it"
" It's all about the motivation and the purpose behind why you want to engage, you have an unmet need again, or it's something that you want to interest in and get more knowledge on"
"Yeah, and I think Pfizer is developing a new way in which you can access those directly from a healthcare perspective or healthcare perspective"
" With that in mind, so I know that, whereas historically, you go, if you want to find information about a Pfizer product, you would be speared to their sort of like it'd be like a Pfizer pro, who as it's turned, but actually, it's an access for all of, you know, the clinical data that's relevant to a particular medicine"
 What they're doing now is building on that to enable people like yourself to access to meeting contents as well
 So rather than wait for somebody to contact you
" It's a case of, is there anything for export that I'm interested in available"
 And it will be a way of sign pushing
 And I think that's how
"I like that, you know, you know, having a repository of information or, you know, webinars or seminars that you've already done, accessible at a convenient in time for me"
 Okay
 That's a good idea
 I don't know why other people aren't taught that already
"Well, that is, to be honest, it's still in development"
Yeah
 I appreciate there's probably some regulatory issues around it as well
"No, well, I think as long as the content on there is approved, that's that, you know, the issue that we have is making sure that we've got content approved"
" And also, if there's anything that it's accessible, it's updated in line with any changes to any, any of the SPC's or so"
 So that would be the only issue
 So you'd have a time lag there for some of that material content
" I think also, if there's any patient material that needs to be accessed as well, again, I would see in the future that you'll be able to access it and forward it in any communication that you'd have with a patient rather than use something physical, which again, at the moment isn't something where or is happening within other pharma companies"
" So yes, I think if there's the service, but you feel as a value is education and how you delivered it, once you become familiar with how the service that we're offering has been set up"
 I have
"Can, can I slightly interrupt you, my GP's ringing me, I'm just gonna stick you on mute for a second, is that okay"
"Yes, that's okay"
"So sorry, Kevin, these GP's, they tell you, they're grabbing you at 10 o'clock in the morning, and then they bring you out 1"
19 ridiculous
 Sorry
That's okay
" It's okay, I was just sat here and I thought, I thought like I was prying, you know, when somebody is having a conversation and you just sory of"
"You couldn't hear me, you couldn't hear me could you"
"No, I couldn't"
"Good, good"
"No, I can assure you none of that was recorded at all"
 But
It's fine
It's fine
 It's but it's probably realistic
" Because in reality, I have a lot of meetings and have a colleague walk in behind you obviously you can't see them"
" And I'm like, What's the matter"
 And then I've got a question to ask
" And they will just interrupt and ask a question, even though you're on a call"
"How have you managed to sort of navigate working from home more I guess, in your role"
 Or is that completely
I don't work from home
" No, no I had the option, I had option of working from home, I could have done my job from home"
" But for me, it was about leadership presence"
"Yeah, absolutely"
So I lead a team of about 13 people
" And they will have children, they will have their own struggles, but their jobs involve them being at work"
" So, they have to be on site"
" For me it was morally and you know, incorrect for me to be spending time at home when they needed my support"
" Of course, it's an emotionally distressful time"
 It's difficult
" You know, people have got think people out there and families look after, you know, I had one of my colleagues have their mother in law diagnosed with a brain tumor"
 And they only found out she was having regular falls
" But she was quite severe, but no one could go and see them"
 And that's the stress for them
" But if I'm, if I'm at home, I can't support my workforce"
" So I chose, I chose to go into work for that reason"
Yeah
" And it's interesting as well, because some of the challenges that people will face from working from home, are not apparent until you suddenly go right, so you wondering, I'm going to work from home, you're working from home"
" And like you say, it's kind of like, No, I don't drive a car, like don't have a lot or don't have great internet connection"
"Our trust is brilliant in that sense that were they provided laptops, they provided even screens, chairs desks the full whack"
" Yeah, they went really, you know, far out and a lot of our backroom staff are working from home indefinitely, and we've proven it works"
" What I will say is though, you know, even Kevin, even the fact that I haven't met you in person, we're having a chat on on the thing, we're still going to have the same level of rapport had been met in person"
"Yes, I agree"
" I agree, as well"
" And I think also that perhaps there's less distractions, like you say, you do get the occasional where somebody is coming into a room"
" But you know, you've got some times that's aside"
" And equally, and I personally believe that this, I find it a bit more engaging, you know, it's a cycle, it's a bit more intimate"
" You know, in term of that, and yeah, a little bit, but we're all very comfortable with it all very quickly, as well"
"In terms of whatever the objectives are below with me, that's fine"
" The people who are working from home will meet the objectives, they're probably more productive"
" But actually, in terms of that team building the the morale side of things, you know, you know, I've got people who've worked with me for years"
" And, you know, one day they walk in, and they're behaving differently, I know something's up straight away"
" If you're working from home and having a 15 minute chat in the morning, over coffee, but we were sitting miles apart, you're not going to have that insight into what's going on"
" And it's that human side of interaction, which I really prioritize"
 And I think that's one of the reasons why I've got the best people in my team
"Yeah, brilliant well that's nice to hear"
 Yeah
" So whilst you're working with your media team like that, have you found it challenging then to work with any external partners that you have or from, you know, whether it be people that are involved in home care delivery, service itself, that you've been working with, or commissioners, where you've had to sit in meetings, and you just feel I'm not being heard"
 Or I'm not getting the opportunity to speak
" Or this is not, you know"
I don't think I don't think it's been a case of not being heard
" You have the raise hand function in MS teams, which is great"
"It's just, you know, dodgy internet connections don't help"
" And the fact that you're sitting in your office for the full four hours through a meeting or seminar, and it's just it, it's mentally draining"
Yeah
Yeah
" And yeah, if you're overweight and got a bad bad back like me, you need to get up every, every 20 30 minutes"
 So
"Interestingly, we Pfizer have been really good at acknowledging that the time is spent in front of a screen isn't productive"
" And they've given us access to a wellness app, you know, so headspace and encourage you to pickc up activity away from the desk, that allows you just to re energize yourself or refocus or however you want to phrase it or frame it, you know, so that you can get away in that"
" And I suppose the challenge that you've got is that if you are sat there and you feel that you're, you know, in a meeting, and you do want to have a little bit of a leg stretch, and it's difficult, unless you just sort of say"
"Just switch my camera off, and just"
"It isn't it, you suddenly become quite adapt to being able to make an excuse for excusing yourself, you know, yeah"
 Yeah
 Yeah
So it's got its pros and cons
" But again, you know, what"
 The face to face is just a whole
" It's a whole different dynamic, hasn't it"
Yeah
" You know, I think what I really enjoyed about the conversation today is the fact that actually, like you say, when you move away from the prescriptive discussion, it's really nice just to have, you know, connect with somebody"
 And this is a really nice way of being able to do as well
" And I think I've enjoyed that, you know, from that"
" So, yeah, thank you for taking the time"
Sorry
 Sorry about that interruption
 I'm not sure how your AI's going to deal with that
 But yeah
I think I think it will probably look at me and go
 How do you like that
" What do you do with your time when you're not able to connect with you, the person you're speaking with"
 Is there buffering
" You know, how can you look a little bit more engaged"
 Because I'm sure I just looked at multiple
 Need some acting tips or something
"So yeah, there you go"
 That is it was a glimpse into reality
 So
"Yeah, I'm conscious of your time"
" And just say so your next call is half past, isn't it"
Yes
 Yes
" So yeah thank you Kevin, i hope that was"
Thank you too
And the one one question I do have is we never really got around to which area you cover
We didn't reveal it did we
 So the big reveal
" I cover in East Anglia, which is just a below you really isn't it so in that respect from an STP perspective"
" So I'm Cambridgeshire, Peterborough is currently where I work"
Yeah
" Yeah, I do"
 Yeah
"Cambridgeshire is somebody, somehwere that's on my horizon for the future"
"Somebody to work, or"
"Yes, it's a massive Tertiary centrism"
"Yes, it is"
 It is
" And, and I think some of the ways in which you've described your the ways in which you'd like to work, it would suit you there as well"
 There is a lot autonomy there is and project work as well
" There is a you know, really interesting spin involved in, so"
" Yeah and you've got some really good clinical experts, which is something that you also mentioned"
" So yeah, yeah something to get involved in in the future, Well, listen, maybe in some future, forward to working with you, perhaps"
Absolutely
Cheers
Absolute pleasure
 Thank you so much
"You too, thank you"
" Bye bye now, bye"
