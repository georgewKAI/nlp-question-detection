"Yes, so my two main roles both in the same area"
" So I'm the manager of a GP Federation called Hadrian, care alliance, which is covers about 11, perhaps well, sort of covers 11 to 14 practices"
" But there's, it's a wide geographic area, so very rural"
 And one of our practices covers 600 square miles
 And so quite big
 Yeah
" And as a federation, we have a, the last probably five, maybe seven years held a contract an AQP contract any qualified provider for warfarin monitoring"
 uh that's by the CCG
" And, and obviously, those the numbers on warfarin have significantly reduced and COVID certainly accelerated that"
" However, those because it's such a geographic rural area, even though as practices, we have six practices who do the, the monitoring them, it's not financially viable"
" Well, it's not, it doesn't bring in loads of money"
" But it's regarded as being really important for those patients who cannot be moved on to a DOAC and, can't travel, really"
" So it's really important that they, we continue to provide a service that's close to the patient"
" And so that's what that's the walkway, and we're looking at whether we can develop a wider sort of anticoagulation monitoring service that would be commissioned"
 I don't know
" And, and the and the other role briefly, just briefly is as management leads the West Northumberland primary care network, which is similar because of the same geographic area,"
"It's something I don't know how it would work I would need to, and it's not helped by I suppose every single, every practice working in a slightly different way"
 And they've always done it that way
 So we don't see a need
" And, yeah, I mean, that the rurality does create challenges on so many"
"No, I, I don't know, to be honest"
 I've got a feeling
 And I need to give you about got a feeling they get referred in
 There has been in em
 I'm sure I've seen something sort of across the CCG potentially looking at D-dimer service
 And I know that was introduced in another area where I was working on Tyneside
" So yeah, I mean, potentially, potentially, that would"
" Yeah, I don't know"
" No, no, no, that's terrible"
 Because I don't work in a practice
Sometimes you don't get the question
" You say, Oh, I need to find that out"
 But there are several practices because the first timeDo it won't be the same for everybody else
The spoil this two main trusts in the area
" There's, there's Northumbria hospitals acute trust, which is probably the biggest"
" Well, I mean, they're both very big and they're both very, you know, in financial surplus, and but then one part of it, several of our practices in one particular area will link in more to the other  can create problems, particularly in relation to bloods, because one in Northumbria, they use ICE, but Newcastle hospitals doesn't"
"Sorry could I ask Firstly, what does ESC stand for"
And what's it apologies for the ignorance in terms of what's defined as a provoked and unprovoked
And that's why because interested in I probably had COVID in early March in mid March
" And I think when I remember ringing 111, and then to go through the process, because eventually got to speak to a GP because and they asked about whether they've been on any long journeys, where was sat down for quite a while don't get them on"
 Was it more than three hours or more than two hours journey
 So to rule out a potential PE
"Cos the problem that I think we have or one of the problems at the moment is, whereas in lockdown one bit or wave one, it this case was stopping everything, and just focusing on COVID"
" And it never reached here, as it has in wave in wave two"
" And this time, we've got to keep it do COVID and vaccinate, and keep everything else good"
" It's quite challenging to get people to think about prevention in that in that is a real, actually, but you're then going to get is further down the line, much more acute stuff, because we haven't the capacity, there isn't the capacity now to focus on much on the prevention area, which is worrying it which is really worrying"
"And approximately what percentage it is that increase your sort of at risk pool by in general, that I think that that's middle, that intermediate level"
"I'm just thinking if it's sort of like, increases it by like 200% or here that's a very different proposition"
 It increases it by 15%
"What was the title of it, do you have the title"
That's more
" I mean, that's a huge risk"
 And it's more in terms of sort of the non patient numbers
" Yeah,"
"And in other areas, because it meant, I mean, you mentioned that group of practices"
 Can you describe that model to me and how that works
"Particularly the next year when you you know, in the next 12 months when you don't want hospitals won't want"
" No, we will know to be honest"
" Yes, that would be a win for them in terms of Yeah, yeah"
 Social distancing and keeping minimizing footfall
 Yeah
"Because I pressume then in terms of equipment, that's quite an expensive investment are quite significant investment"
" So yeah, yeah"
 If you've got one hub that makes it more financially viable if you've got more than one hub
"And you need it in terms of you need clinician who has sort of passionate, you have a passion and they're really interested to get everybody else on board"
" Yeah,"
"yes, yeah"
 You will be
Bye
