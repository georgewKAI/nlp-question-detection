Hello
"Oh, well, that's very nice of you"
" I'm Klaus, I'm a cardiologist"
 I work in Leeds
" I have a half time research and half time, clinical responsibility, I run the heart failure unit in Leeds and I also do pacemaker implantation defibrillaters and stuff"
" And I also, until last month ran the VTE Governance Program for the trust that has been taken over now not unreasonably by a hematologist who has recently been appointed specifically to this role"
" But up until then, there wasn't a hematologist who was taking on this chair role"
" Which meant I managed a very small team of specialists, pharmacists and nurses to do VTE assessments and also do the root cause analysis assessments for people who have hospital acquired VTE's and to and to write the operating protocols for anticoagulation or prophylactic anticoagulation for people coming into hospital"
 And my research interests are around heart failure and device therapy
" So pacemakers, basically how to program them how to use them properly, and how to get the best out of them"
" And so the last that I've been fairly protected, because my primary employer is the university so and I don't do any clinical on call anymore the last few years"
 So I didn't do much in the way of COVID direct facing COVID work but myself and the other x clinical academics ran the outpatient service while our full time clinicians were running the COVID wards
" And so that kind of changed our timetables a little bit, we managed to spend a fair we've I mean, the one thing that has changed is we barely go in"
" So on a Tuesday, on a Wednesday or Thursday, I spend all day in the hospital"
 But I don't do any Ward work
" So Monday, Tuesday, Friday, my research has been run entirely without face to face, which is kind of difficult"
"Yeah, it's a pain because it because if you're doing mouse work, mice don't get COVID as far as we know"
" So, university shut down everything"
" So my basic science, collaborators struggled for a little while"
 And not because the mice were getting infected
" But because the university felt that there was risks to them going in and working on their, on their animal models and on their basic science, and even the people doing data analytics were barred from going home, from going into work sorry"
" that's now settled largely, and we have a large number of people coming and going for part of the week"
 And but my group is clinical
" So our patients, our patients are our subjects"
 And we're at risk of COVID
" And therefore we have to shut down all clinical research from March until very recently, some very recently, in September started doing clinical clinical research again, which is a real pain"
" And yeah, but but but there we are, so things are starting to settle down a little bit"
"And, well, about a month ago, I've been doing it for about eight years"
 Okay
" And because it was seen as a non hematology problem, because this is this is not the treatment of DVT and PE's, but the prevention, although I was involved in in the medical and most of the patients, of course, not hematology patients, there medical patients, surgical patients"
" So the role kind of got invited or assigned to a cardiologist as it had been for many years, partly because we do an awful lot of anticoagulation anyway"
" And yeah, but not unreasonably, in the summer, when the hematologist was appointed"
 She had some space in her in her timetable
So she's now taking that on
 And so I did it until about a month ago
"Yes, so um in in general, the prophylactic and the prophylactics involves obviously low molecular weight heparin, we have shied away from mechanical treatments or mechanical prevention treatments, because the data are really not robust enough, although the surgeons are still quite keen on stockings and inflatable legs and stuff"
" But we really have focused down, we had some issues with delivery to the balance between Tinxaparin and Enoxaparin as you know, towards the end of last year, 2019 became very difficult"
 So we had to change our protocols there
" And in terms of treatment, well, we follow the standard NICE guidelines, there's nothing radical there at all"
 Most people are offered a NOAC
" And in with a loading dose, and then and then a maintenance dose, I think"
"So we had had a fairly relaxed approach to it, we have always favored either using rivaroxaban, or apixaban in our population, based on patient preferences around volume of tablets per day"
 I think apixaban was was the flay was the primary and primary approach
" Most people use apixaban, some people were fans of rivaroxaban, but partly simply because of the once a day thing"
 And for older people or people with large volumes of tablets on multiple medications
 So but but it was we never really used much in the way of the other agents for this particular indication
 So it was never really we never really had to change that much when it came through that
" Yeah, as you say that apixaban is should be highly favored"
 It didn't make much difference to our protocols
Sorry the what profile
 The lead profile
recommendations
 And that and that recommendation is bigger than that recommendation is apixaban long term
"Yeah, it didn't"
"We didn't, we didn't come down on advising changing"
" um I have to say, I don't I'm not a I'm not a huge fan of because of course, remember by then they're not really our patients anymore, right"
 They're under the primary care
 So our protocols were around the acute management
" So in the mouth, shortly after discharge, and then they usually get a letter to the GP saying this is what's happened"
 You could consider changing to apixaban in six months time if there's still an elevated risk
 But we didn't mandate that that really wasn't we didn't see that as being particularly our role in telling GP's what to do once the patients are under their care
" And yeah, then maybe I have that maybe I have that wrong"
" So the advice from NICE, presumably says that if they remain at elevated risk, you should convert them to apixaban long term is that  what NICE said"
No no thats absolutely fine
"Yes, it's a long it's a long description"
" So that's why we, we stopped we made it very much simpler and said, Look, you know, if they're tolerating what they're on, and it's a it's a patient choice really"
" Because we didn't I have, I always worry slightly about the real world risks of changing people if you if you don't get continuity, or then there's a decision made well, you know, what changing is all like let's, let's just stop it or something"
" You know, any change to patient regiments has to be very carefully considered, particularly when you're in a busy primary care setting"
" So we didn't, we didn't mandate that"
 But we did reflect the guidelines in our guide the guidelines in our operating protocols
"And yes, I agree"
" It hasn't really filtered through dramatically, as well as it could have done because of course, the patients were were largely not returning for follow up appointments"
" So what would happen given the pandemic situation is that one would make a follow up telephone call and, and make a decision on whether they needed long term treatment"
" And then and then write to the GP and say, you can either change or you can leave it because you'd know whether the patient is tolerating it"
 And and I have to say that I suspect most people would have left is the last thing GP's want to be doing in the midst of a pandemic is bringing in a load of people who are stable on rivaroxaban and organizing a change to apixaban for what they might see as marginal benefits
" And somebody who's done quite well, I appreciate the benefit"
 I appreciate the leading risk is lower with apixaban perhaps no question about that
" But but on balance, I think most people will have taken a view and said the risks of organizing a switch are somewhat lower, with a face to face appointment may be somewhat lower than just leaving them on rivaroxaban at the moment"
" So it's a difficult time that you have to get this NICE recommendation widely, widely implemented"
"No, I agree"
 I think you're right Sarah
" I don't think there's any I don't, I don't think many people are doing it"
 It wouldn't surprise me if the if the conversion rate is very low
"Yeah I mean, I think I think I think your job is very difficult at the moment, people are so focused on things"
 Yeah
" So So and, and, and trying to bring out an a change"
 And that is probably a long term
" So this is the challenge, right"
" You only ever know the bleeds that you didn't, that you caused"
 You don't know about the bleeds that you prevented or avoided
" And, and, and, but you certainly know about the hassle that you had in getting the patient from one agent to another"
" So that there's all sorts of conflicts, the data really haven't been widely advertised, in terms of the way we manage it"
" And the way the protocols are implemented, given the current situation, we just rewrote everything in March"
" Saying, Don't come to the hospital, we'll do it over the phone"
" And I think so I think over the next 12 months, your job and none of your colleagues will have to be to make sure these NICE guidelines are fully implemented the big job"
"yeah, absolutely"
" That's always, always the way though"
Yes
" Yes, no question"
 But it but it has fallen down the priority list unfortunately
 Yeah
" So, so this will need readdressing"
 I think the data are compelling
" And but when you're fighting fires, it's really hard for the primary care of physicians, most of whom are the ones looking after these people"
" Now, I i think i think your point is very well made"
" And I think that certainly the patients that remain under secondary care follow up and would would, would be converted"
 But those people who have gone to primary care follow up
" So these are people presumably who have an ongoing indication for DVT and V, VTE prophylactic"
" These are people who presumably had an unexplained event, and not those with cancer or so"
 So that so there's an issue there
 Yeah okay
" So those are those are that's the problem, though, those are rarely under"
 those are rarely under secondary care long term
" You see, that's the problem you have unexplained"
"Yes, in three minutes, but don't worry"
I have
" I have a desktop here that has emails coming in at a rate of knots, so I felt the need to continue to do some work between meetings"
And have you got other meetings today
