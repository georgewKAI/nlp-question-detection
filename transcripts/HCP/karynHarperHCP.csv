"Hi, yeah"
I am
 Yes
 Thank you
 Everybody else has taken 30 minutes
" So yeah,"
I thought it was 15
" And then was like, Oh, okay"
Yeah absoeverybody else is
" So you know, only fair, you have the same crack at the whip"
No I work in the center of Newcastle
That's a common thing
 Yes
 So you've all thought I'm a pcn
"Erm I think that, yeah, that's, it's all right, everybody gets that bit kinda wrong"
" I am a clinical pharmacist, but I'm employed by the practice and have been placed before well before the PCN's"
" Erm I do you have two pcn pharmacists, in my practice as part of my team"
" And I, I've been a clinical pharmacist in primary care for many, many years and was part of the original focus group that brought about the NHS England pharmacists in general practice training"
 So and have been part of different processes in recruiting and bringing the scheme into place and through into the PCNs as well
" So whilst I'm not a PCN pharmacist, I do know what is going on in terms of the experience and things"
"Yeah, so that's exactly what happens, in any practice based pharmacist will be have a different role from practice to practice, because every practice is individual and their needs are different"
" and so my role when I was originally employed by the practice, erm so four years ago, was to help free GP time by taking some of that chronic disease management"
" So seeing patients after annual review, or titrating blood pressures and seeing new hypertensives, do respiratory that kind of thing"
 And over over the years that sort of extends quite extended quite a bit
" So a clinic for me can run from doing some sort sorting somebody has hypertension out to doing inhalers with asthma or COPD, even down the point of diagnosing asthma or COPD, as you know, some of the time"
" Well, a lot of the time that kind of gets passed on to me to interpret the spirometry for and the the history and then a treatment plan in place and follow through"
 Erm pain is quite a big area
" Errm not only in treating pain, but actually in D prescribing opioids and gabapentinoids and depression and HRT contraception, lots of things come through"
" and it does get a bit of it kind of 'oh, it's medication so pharmacists can deal with it'"
" Yeah, yeah"
 So that even happened even though I've been established for a long time
" They know me and things that happened yesterday, you know, rgt doctor was really really busy and she sent me a screen message going, do you think you can handle these two insulin titration patients"
 and it was sort of a hard no
 I have literally never done it
 I know
 I know the theory
 I know
" about it, I'm happy to talk with you, but doing it on my own"
" No, I can't do that"
" But it was a case of look, you do that and I will see what else I can do off your list"
 Yeah
 So that you've got this space
" So I took a query from a social worker about a patients medication, a rescue pack patient that needs to be dealt with"
 And I picked up a lot of her prescriptions and just got those all sorted for us
 So it was more of I'm helping in a different way
"I am yeah, and, you know, that's, that's how I was bought in that kind of thing"
" And then over the years, I've kind of got involved in different bits and pieces"
" So I lead the the flu vaccination program, and I'm involved in a lot of the other vaccination programs, sort of shingles, pneumonia, things like that"
" Yeah, and I do a lot of training of all the other different people in my, in my practice, nearly everybody, at some point has got had some kind of training input from me"
" Whether it's training HCA's up, or whether it's doing updates with clinical staff, or do it, you know, demystifying things for their admin"
" Erm so things make a little bit more sense when we have new, we were training practice"
" So we always have trainees in Yeah, they they have sessions with me, when our staff are going through their independent prescribing"
" Erm at least half of the seminars are with me, and some of the supervision work as well"
" So you know, there's lots of different things that I've got involved in, over the years"
" And behind that, you've also got that kind of responsibility for like, prescribing processes, what's happening with that prescribing safety"
" Erm my, with my team, I have a pharmacy technician, and a medicines manager as well and they do a lot of the medicines reconciliation from letters and discharges"
" Okay, and so it's sort of supervised and then the input with what they're doing"
" And then as we've grown and all we've got the pcn pharmacists, so one joined us last year"
 Erm so there was two pcn pharmacist for our seven practices
" Erm so she spent time with us, and then also covering a couple of other practices as well"
 Erm and then the PCM decided to recruit more
 Okay
" Erm so she came, she's now full time with us and we've got a second full time PCN pharmacist as well, who's just joined eight weeks ago"
" So it's building building them into the team, as well making sure that their roles from the days around SMR and prescribing safety and the targets and things that they have to hit are actually built into our processes rather than being"
That their built in and doing things and because even then the PCN role
No no that's okay
 I was just gonna say the PCN role is still to sort of it's to help the practices in whichever way they need that help
" So whilst they still have, although they have the DES, actually the biggest part of what they need to do is help the practice"
"Yeah, pincers quite extensively used"
 I found with pincer that's only as good as the data that's inputted
" Erm so and that's the same with a lot of tools, it is only as good as the data that's there"
 Erm so it can flag up quite you can initially from a dashboard look quite horrific
 Yeah
" But one, unless you actually sort of know, kind of, well, I know at least half of my D marked patients, for example, the Bloods are done by the hospital, so they're not going to be in my system for me to find so whilst that looks like horrific, I know it actually isn't when I go through it"
"Yeah so one of the things I actually did a couple of years ago as developer safety, a prescribing safety tight rolling timetable, because there are so many areas pincer covers six I think, yeah, generally"
" But then you there's so many other areas that we want to look at DOACs for example, making sure that's all being done, you know, lots and lots of different things"
" Erm and that, that's a mammoth task"
" Erm and taking DOACs, particularly, that task is just growing and growing and growing"
" Yeah, and, you know, four, four or five years ago, when I first started, or longer than that, sorry, six years ago, when I first started sort of putting in a bit of a more regular DOAC monitoring check"
" Erm I had about 60, or 70 patients in a 10,000 practice"
" And as you know, we're 23,000 patients now, and got maybe upwards of four 500"
" So what used to take me two full days to work through, could take me two full weeks to work through"
 Erm so we've had to think a little bit on our feet about how we can do that more in a more manageable manner
 And what we can do to do that
" Erm so I our rolling timetable just means that we've got one or two areas that we're focusing on that month, but we're going to revisit those every six months"
 Yeah and it makes it a little bit more manageable and doing things like that
 So there's a few bits and pieces out there that we use
In what kind of way
That that was raised
 But that wasn't something that really particularly happens
 Okay
 And I did prepare for it
"It was one of those things that erm I suppose I'm quite lucky in terms of the clinical director for the PCN is that one of the partners at the practice, yeah, and the, like manager for the PCN is also our manager"
" So sometimes they did come to me quite early on and go, there may be a problem with the Warfarin services, can we, you know, can you start working up what we would need to do if we had to move people across"
 So I'd worked that all up
" And then of course, in the primary care, cardiac society, one came out, and I would say, I've done this now"
 Too late
" And actually, I think mine was a little bit more pragmatic, I could understand there's, you know, they've got to make sure they're covering things quite safely"
" Erm because I've worked in Warfarin services, and and, you know, I've prescribed warfarin and altered warfarin, according to ionize"
" I was a little bit more pragmatic and a bit more, yeah, like right, your last INR's have been their, we'll just skip it for a couple of days, you'll be fine"
 We don't need to worry about checking
"Yeah, a little more pragmatic, of overall that is going to manage the majority of patients where I can see they've been in range for a long time, they're highly unlikely something is, is suddenly sent them off"
" But I can see from a national protocol, you can't do that"
" So you know, I understood that"
" Erm so we actually didn't, and we didn't have to, in the end"
 And our Warfarin services were actually had put things in place
 They were extending stable patients to reduce the cut points
" Erm I think a lot of places where it did impact them was where the practices themselves, we're managing Warfarin"
Yes
 So you've got a centralized service
We've got a centralized service we really need that
"there has been a few few patients that have been worked through, where they've not been particularly stable"
" And, you know, it's felt to be sort of a safer opportunity in terms of doing that"
" And we have worked through with a few of those, and they're still working through with some of those as well"
 And that's less to do with sort of COVID and more to do with these patients aren't stable erm and could come to harm from either under or over anticoagulation and we need to be anyway
" Yeah, you know, so you know, we've got that in place, and we're starting to do a bit more collaborative work erm with the trust around that, so, so yeah, that that's happening"
" Erm I guess the only other kind of thing, the other kind of things where it's sort of impacted more recently is sort of new patients"
 Yeah
 A lot more patients on doacs
" Yeah, at the moment"
" Erm because of the, because of the thrombo embolic erm risk with COVID"
" So patients are on shorter courses from coming out of hospital, things like that"
" Erm making sure that's all going on, we are seeing more VTEs happen"
" But also sort of from an AF point of view, when you've got a new patient who has been picked up how you do that"
" You know previously, I would have them in an appointment, well actually put a double appointment quite a 20 minute appointment"
" Yeah, go through a patient decision aids with them explain what the numbers mean, in real terms to them"
" Erm, and give them the different all the different information about the choices and send them away with it and give them a ring a few days later to go right what are we what are your thoughts on what we're going to do with that"
 We can't do that
 So we've got to think about how we're going to do that
 Am I going to send them the information and then ring them and then you've got them on the phone going 'I'll Just find the piece of paper and have a look and I didn't understand it
 And what does this mean
' Are you going to try and do it without it
 Which case you're trying to get across a hell of a lot of information that you're asking them to get
 It's all been quite different
 And you've had to sort of change it according to the patient and how they're responding to different things
Or they don't want to get on it
" So you know, you learn a few other bits and pieces like, well, what size clothes do you wear then"
" Yeah, you know, you try to make a bit of a judgment call on that"
 Erm I've also found they don't lie about the size of clothes as much as they lie about the weight
"I don't know whether well, it was something I actually picked up from and a training seminar about HRT right, in like managing HRT in COVID"
" And sort of recognizing that women may not have scales or may not want to get on them or may not want to tell you that number it's highly personal, you know, and, and the consultant Diana Mansoor, who's like, brilliant in her field, erm she said, you know, ask about dress size"
" Yeah, ask about dress size, that will give you some idea of whether their BMI is above or below 30"
 And whether you be thinking about the risks or not
" Erm and often, you know, if you think about yourself, if somebody said to you, what's your weight or you were having a phone call where you knew you going to be asked about your weight"
" You may already in your head, be going 'oh going to knock a few kilos off that one'"
"Where is if somebody's out of the blue sort of goes 'Oh, what dress size are you"
' You're more we're more likely to just say it needs to go right
 Yeah
 We'll do that
Sometimes
 it backfires
"yeah, that was it"
 That's been really quite helpful during bits and pieces like that
 Just trying to think a little bit more different
" Erm that's been a big thing that you know, a lot of things are by telephone, you can't see the patient"
" So, you know, trying to think a little bit differently in terms of what you're asking"
 Erm trying to be a little bit trying to get the answers a bit better
From them
"There's a lot of digital poverty so this kind of thing is, is not"
 There is some times where we do it
 Yeah
" And where we can do it that as a lot of time where there's possibly no benefit in it, or it would be physically quite difficult"
" Erm so, you know, I'd love to do this kind of thing for inhaler technique and things like that"
"But a lot of our patients may not have a laptop or they may be doing a video call off their phone, if they do have the data and asking them to sort of hold the phone and take"
It just completely cut out from my end
"Oh, now it's saying is saying some video not currently available"
 Can you see me
I don't know quite how to get rid of that
 Because I've only got one open
I know the girls do
" Erm they had there's lots they've either built searches themselves, or there's actually quite a lot of resources out there from different people to support primary care like Ardennes and, erm primary care first, things like that, that that develop a lot of the searches and things for them"
We have a lot as a lot of Ardennes everywhere
 A lot of it is brilliant
 Yeah and doing that
" So yeah, there is part of that erm what we're trying to move toward, which initially was how our first PCN pharmacists was working, was to work off lists of sort of higher risk and things like that"
 Yeah
 Erm what we are now trying to do is actually established the process of SMR's into our annual review process for the patient
" Yeah, rather than having this often second standalone review happening"
" It's confusing for the patients because they're like, well, I've had my annual review, what is going on"
" Erm and, you know, it's making more use of what's happening"
" Yeah, and actually being more useful to the practice in terms of freeing up the time of the GP's who are doing the annual reviews"
 Yeah
 So that they are free for the other demand
" Yeah, that's going on"
" So I think whilst that does play apart, and in terms of actively searching for them, it may not be the whole way and it may not be what we do long term with it"
"Erm so, to a certain extent, yes, yeah"
" So I'm pretty sure our health care's assistant, so we do a year of care"
" And so they'll have an initial information gathering stage, which is generally with a healthcare assistant, that would be the obs and the bloods and asking about smoking, alcohol, exercise, diet, that kind of thing"
 And part of that will be a pulse check
 Yeah
Erm so there will be that part of it
" Erm we, you do automatically do a little bit of detection, if you're doing sort of blood pressures when you're listening to"
" Yeah, when you're doing a blood pressure with it because we all use manual blood pressure, rather than automatic"
" Yeah, we do have them but we don't, we don't as a practice, we prefer not to use them we prefer to use manual"
" Erm so you do you know, you are there in certain situations sort of going"
" Well, that doesn't sound quite right"
"Yeah, I'm just gonna double check that a second and then were part of the HSN project around AF, erm up here"
 So we've got one of the alive core devices
" Yeah erm and for some reason, it sits in my drawer"
 Lucky you
 I think mostly because the nurses lost it once and we all got a little bit petrified at how we were going to replace 100 pounds worth of
 It was who was going to be the one to tell the partners that we needed to replace it
"Yeah, so it's kind of in my drawer and I will have, I will just sort of whip it out and sort of explain very quickly, this is gonna just do a quick check, put your fingers on sit quietly, let's see what comes up erm if something, you know, it gives that reassurance of probably was just ectopics or something else that was going on"
" Or that does look a bit weird erm right, let's get you here's an ECG card"
 Let's go and get you get that sorted and see what's happening with it
" Yeah, we have identified a few patients that way, and sort of done things done things along that route"
" Erm so, you know, there is an element, I don't fit and over the years, there have been sort of more official sort off detection programs, there's been this sort of pulse checks at flu clinics and things like that"
The official kind of projects
" Certainly, that's not happening at the moment, because you don't want to be in that two meter zone very well"
"No so at the minute, that kind of thing isn't where isn't sort of happening, but is around"
"Completely understand because I think if you rocked up to my practice, and went can I have half an hour with you just to chat about what it is you do"
 I would I would send you packing
"I don't I don't have time to have my lunch, let alone do that"
You're welcome
 And thank you
"Yes, that's it for me"
