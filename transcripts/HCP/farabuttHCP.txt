"Yes, yes yeah, all good in tier three, what tier are you in"
 whereabouts
And I've tried to do it
 And I really am trying to buy more from small businesses
" And yes,"
So there's a really good Facebook page called not on Amazon
 And there's some really good
Yes
 Not on Amazon
"so all small shops are open, no restaurants or pubs are all in It can't socialise, can't mix households"
 So
"Yeah and I think and now that vaccines are coming in, we'll be starting with those"
I think that really helps
"And not so, well"
 I suppose what the impact that it has on my role is mean that I'd be much more remote working
"So which is in a way good, and it means you can actually attend board meetings, which isn't necessarily a good thing"
 So yeah
" But in the area that I work so I'm work as management lead for West Northumberland primary care network, and I'm also manager of Hadrian primary care alliance, which is in the GP Federation"
" So yeah, so where we are is a huge geographic area"
" So when we were having PCN board meetings, which we still are, but we're going to monthly, but when we used to meet face to face, we used to rotate amongst the practices, but that sometimes can mean traveling for up to an hour to get there"
" And so, you know, the two hour meeting become four hours of the time needed"
" Yeah, it's more efficient"
" And yeah, yeah, I mean, has it has changed"
" I mean, certainly, I think a lot of the practices, you know, it's really accelerated these are digital technologies"
"Um it can be challenging at times and sometimes amazing thinking,"
I know something about this
" I can't say anything because in the context of my call, and it's not people, I think where were the difference is and and we differ in terms of it's not the same footprint in terms of practices"
" So a lot, certainly we've got two practices in the area"
 So there's 14 practices in the locality
" And 11 of them are members of the Federation 12 members of the PCN and two, but they're not always the same"
 Two aren't members of a PCN
"And so I think where they difference really is, is, as a PCN, It's allowed, like, from what you're mandated to do, or what you have to deliver is very much directed by NHS England at the moment"
 Yeah
 Yeah
" So it's about delivering the network contract days, and all those elements of it"
 Yeah
" Whereas from a federation perspective, we can do whatever we want to do"
" So at the moment, we sort of have a range of services, including one wafarin monitoring one, which isn't financially isn't very feasible isn't finacially viable really, but because it's the DOAC's"
" But because we live in such a rural area, it's really important that the services are kept close to the patient"
" So keeping that service going, because otherwise it'd be too difficult for patients to have to go to the hospital or whatever"
 Yeah
No
 So the federal the Federation has the see the wolf and the wafarin monitoring contracts
" So we've been, we've been commissioned, we were commissioned to do that god several years ago now as part of AQP any qualified provider contract"
" And so I think six of the practices do so we buy their licenses, I do all the contract monitoring, and six practices provide the service to the patients"
"So no, because it was one of the services that we got notification very quickly of that that is being continued"
 So it was a must do service to continue
" And, obviously, I think there was a process of by all practices when they were providing the service, I'm not really moving as many people as possible from from wafarin onto a DOAC"
"But obviously, there's still a small number of people who can't move, and you will continue to service for"
I think it's an interesting one
" And I think as a federation, we have tended to work with pharmaceutical industry in an exact meeting on Thursday, and we're looking to develop a sort of a position statement of policy, because I think it depends on who you work with, and any sort of GPS you're dealing with"
" I think there's lots of opportunities, and I think at PCN level"
 I think it all depends on your clinical director
" So for example, our clinical director comes from a practice that traditionally has been really don't anything to do with the pharma industry"
"And that's a very different approach to well, you sort of so I'm trying to get that actually, that's maybe a reflection of you as a person but not necessarily relfection of the whole, but we do need to start thinking about their position statement for the PCN, as well as the Federation"
 So I think there's lots more flexibilities around the Federation
" So where we worked with the pharma industry, on a lot of things, actually"
" And we research we have a research contracts away, and we do a lot work with it"
" We've also do industry studies, and we do timeout events and they've always been traditionally Sponsored by pharma, the pharma industry several, several"
" And so it's just about now formalizing what we what our position to be going forward, I think is still, and I don't think people realize how strongly regulators, the pharmaceutical industry is, and I think there's still a perception that about a free lunch and you mean your behavior will be affected by clean"
 And so I think there's lots of lots of opportunities
 And I'm very conscious sort of over the last since COVID been a lot more training and opportunities to and a lot of those have been funded by pharmaceutical industry
" And, and if you're part of my role is sort of getting some GPS on on side to actually say, actually, it's not like that CO in terms of, they can't promote their own products, or whatever"
" But there's still a perception, I think amongst Yeah"
Its fine i get mixed up as well
 And I'm
"I'll say the goals are aligned, very much so the focus is very,"
will it changed changes from year to year
" So basically, the reason for this network contract in PCN's is because I think there's been such a push in the past and the expectation that practices that would work together"
" And certainly, I was aware that to like C Q C was assuming that there'll be a lot of merges"
 So they were expecting primary care registrations to significantly reduce as more and more practices merged
 Yeah
" And that's quite, that's just hasn't happened"
" We've got 1000s of autonomous businesses with very little lever to get them involved apart from you GMS MPMS, called contract to really this PCN is the first time and it's where practices are contractually required to work with each other"
 So that it's been taken quite slowly
" So last year, it was all about extended hours provision"
" This year, there's much more on enhanced health and care homes, and, you know, structured medication reviews getting the difference in I think, the certainly the direction of travel and in, in the board paper that came about integrated care systems from an age thing than last week, or weeks ago, very much about PCN's, and they may well become sort of the commissioners of the future, the terms of not just providing"
 Yeah
" So I think that the PCN's are, are much more of like the voice of what the government wants to do rather than it being what the Federation or practices want to do"
 So I think you need both is complimentary
now
" I'm probably thinking, I'm probably shutting it down"
" So let me know, via whoever and I'll get some of the packs to so we got so many of them"
"think it's just it's the concept of it was good, but I think actually getting the pawprint is that still a goer in terms of the packs"
 But I think it's the products because there's so many personalized companies now
" You know, it's probably easier for people who are much more experienced than me just to go to company to do the personalized thing"
" But, but it's certainly the reason it came about was because when I lost one of my dogs very suddenly, and then this is years ago, and then I saw a sort of play paw print"
" And I thought Oh, that's good idea"
 I'll get that and then trying to do it on my then two dogs
 Made me realize it was the messiest thing I've got
"So it's just an early, drop the clip, print and drop that then I'm sorry, um dental in dental amalgam quick drying dental amalgam"
I have inside
 I have New foundland dogs
" So there very hairy, and oh god it was just a disaster that my poor dog had pink dental amalgam in her fur, for  four weeks"
 And then I came up 
with a guinea pig
" So now came across this, these are um in America, so every baby that's born in America automatically has their hand and footprint done"
" And case, in case they get kidnapped"
" And it's it's used also by the FBI for for fingerprints, but it's completely mess free"
" So you just don't like the little wet wipe, and you just wipe on your finger"
" You need special paper, and then just put your finger on it and it comes up"
" And it's just as much detail as you want, depending on how much pressure you put on"
but i dont have kids that's why
"No, I mean I've worked in my current role"
 I do work freelance anyway
" So I started my first business just up in 1986, doing trading and market research"
 And then a start went freelance again in 1996
 And I've been that ever since 2006
 Yeah 2006
" And, yeah, I really enjoyed"
 So I'm used to that
" doing you know doing a whole different different things I like doing training and education and, you know, keep it"
"I think to be honest, I'm sort of umming and arring about this"
" I think when COVID came and never been busier from a health management perspective, years, like Crikey, now trying to organize the immunization sites with the vaccine"
"It's very, it's very fast changing your fluid"
" So as of last Wednesday, so I was in a meeting with the chief executive, the local trust and all the PCN leads"
" And I think the view at that point was the Pfizer vaccine would only go to hospitals, and people go to hospitals for it"
" And yeah, next day, Thursday, urgent meeting required, because PCN's are required to set up sites by"
" Okay, so so yeah, it's a very, it's a very fluid, it changes on a, an hourly basis"
"I think they're going to immunize that immunizing the over 80's that are in hospitals, then that starts tomorrow, then it will be NHS I still account, I still don't see how it can be given to care home residents, because it can't be moved from the site at the moment"
" So yeah, then"
 So I think we we've been asked this about doing the over 80s for a PCN perspective
 So I think there's going to be two sites in the first wave across Northumberland
" I mean, we still we've got two sites, we still wait for one site to be confirmed"
If you get me your details and you address by whoever then I'll certainly send you some down
Take care and lovely to meet you
 Thank you
Bye
