Please do
" Yes,"
quite interesting
 I hope it's quite interesting from your end
"But I was saying to one of your colleagues, it's gone through phases"
" You know, the first phase was, oh, we can't do that"
 It's terribly technical and difficult
" And then the second phase was actually we quite like doing this and it's saving a lot of petrol and third phases is oh, my goodness, I'm double booked on treble booked, you know, it's a victim of his own success"
 We like it a bit too much
"It has been I mean, you're obviously having to think of new ways of working with the NHS in the same way as the NHS is having to find new ways of working with pharma"
" So yeah, I think, you know, hopefully, we, we came up with some ideas that would work here, not nothing revolution, real world changing"
" But you know, things that work for both sides"
" Yeah,"
"Yeah, just just be versatile"
" Yeah,"
"It's slightly different slant, Rachel"
" So that's, that's fine"
" And do do stop me if I go off in the wrong direction or whatever, but not not at all"
" Yeah, I mean, I mean, I am a GP"
 I'm also a PCN clinical director
" And I'm also director of strategy for our single practice, PCN"
" I mean, that probably most PCNs primary care networks are across more than one practice"
" But we sort of saw this coming and also because of my history of being involved in encompass MCP, you know, March professional clinical provider, and it wasn't a huge jump to go become a PCN because after all, Simon Stephens model the concept of PCN's on the evidence on the new care models including mcps including encompass so we just sort of moved sideways and rebadged it"
" But so, but whereas encompass had five clinical hubs"
" Now, I'm clinical director of one clinical hub which has now been repackaged as a pcn"
 The practice over probably a couple of decades actually has got more and more involved in developing and community integrated healthcare as we call it
" In other words, hopefully high quality general practice alongside a load of stuff you'd have to go to hospital for"
" So in our practice, in one of our buildings history view, we provide a range of outpatients diagnostics and urgent treatment center, a fully compliant ultra clean operating theater where cataract surgery and dermatological surgery has done a bit of orthopedics as well"
" So, you know, it always struck me as nuts when I left medical school, you know, we were one tribe in medical school, then we turn into two tribes, you know, that the general practice tribe and the hospital tribe and I never really see the sense in that I don't see why we can't do things together"
 And so we have over 20 consultants working out at one of our buildings history view
 And we have a number of GPS who are now called chippers that used to be called gypsies
" GP's with a special interest in an NHS can't leave, acronyms alone have to change them"
" So gypsies are now gypers, which means GP with extended role"
" So we have,"
It's been around for a year or so
" But yeah, a lot of people start with Gypsy still, because gyper sounds a bit strange"
" Anyway, that's it"
" But so we do general practice, we do elective care"
 But we also do urgent care from our urgent treatment centers
" So we are the only urgent treatment center, any skin that has virtual fracture clinics face to face fracture clinics"
 So you complete the whole fracture journey without having to go to a hospital
 And also we run a full DVT diagnosis and treatment services
" And that's 12 hours a day, 365 days a year"
" And ultrasound is open six days of the week, which is one more day than the hospitals open"
" And we you know, we try and strive for a good patient experience as much as possible to finish their journey in in our community, rather than have to go to hospital unnecessarily"
" So, you know, as a range of our patients, day procedures, day surgery, and the urgent care side of things, and we have x ray open 12 hours a day, 365 days a year"
" We have a visiting MRI scanner one day a week actually is there permanently at the moment, because the hospitals have got so much COVID there, they've dropped it in our carpark and has been gone"
 So that hopefully gives you some flavor of the integration that we like to do
" And we also employ relevant to your role, we employed two pharmacists, and one pharmacy technician in our practice under the under the scheme that allows pcms to employ people who are called AR s people, you know, Allied something something specialist"
" So yeah, so we've got social prescribers, pharmacists, we just out to advert for a tour operators and a dietitian as well"
 So these are the additional additional roles that we're allowed to employ
"Well, we weren't"
" Yes, yeah, we were an NHS exemplar"
 In the days that exemplars existed
" And then yeah, the core of a new care model called encompass MCP"
 So we've always tried to innovate
" But you know that the principle is the same in everything we do, which is to try and improve the patient experience"
 And that's what we've done
" And we get quite a lot of visitors in, including Simon Stephens himself and Jeremy Hunt, just to come to look at it"
" Now, you know, what, what is this strange thing"
 You've done it
" So yeah, that's it"
"I guess we've all had our challenges, there's no doubt no doubt about that"
" And I mean, one of the first things we did was build a four lane drive thru in the carpark of one of our three surgeries"
" So we we use that initially for COVID patients, that was our hot side or red side, whichever term you prefer to try and protect the buildings and the staff in the buildings from transmission"
" And then that as the first wave settled down a bit, we then started to use it for winter flu vaccination"
 And we found the patients absolutely loved it
 We could do one a minute in each of the four lanes
 So we were doing for a minute here
" You know, 800 was quite easy to do, just driving through, and we had some lovely volunteers who did the traffic management side of things"
" And now we're coming towards the end of our winter flu immunization program, done 80% of over 65"
" Now, people have come in much more than they have in previous years, then yeah, woken up to that it's a good idea"
 And now we're just gearing up to use it as our COVID designated immunization site
 So we've kept it on our own expense
" But people seem to be happier to do that sort of thing in their cars, rather than walking through a building where they're a bit nervous"
" Oh, my goodness, am I gonna catch something"
" So yeah,"
"we've got a good relationship with the community and spoke to one of the local developers and said look, we really think we need this and this is a sketch and blow me down, it was up and operational before the CCG had actually done produced the service specification"
 So they built a thing in a broad traffic management in completely changed all of that in the space of three weeks
" And we were up and running as I say a first off, which was, and it's really been fantastic in that respect, you know, the the public respond to what we're trying to do"
" And they're very supportive, and it's very helpful"
I think a lot of people love the concept
" As you say, I get dragged here, there and everywhere to talk about it"
 And we get a lot of visitors as well
" And people people love it until you say that, too"
 They say how did how was it funded
 Who Who
 Who bought it
 We said actually we did that and then the shoulders go down
"well, I mean, if in a built up area, finding the space is difficult, and yeah, it's a big site"
 But the the problem with general practice funding is you can get something called notional rent or CMR
 The current market rent for g o for GMS buildings
" But if you build something for hospital type work, you're on your own"
 And the principle is simple
 You build it you get a thundering great mortgage and then you try to attract community contracts to pay for the building the staff and you know they need like a bit of surplus
" But that's the point where it gets risky because us as GPS and you know, I'm talking about mon brutes I'm allowed to you know, we're very constitute self employed people, you know, you've got a guaranteed source of income and you know exactly what you're going to get money what you want, but you know what you're going to get the concept of actually spending quite a few million pounds on a new building at risk, because if a CCG won't give you enough contracts for Community Services, then You've got a big mortgage and empty rooms"
 And that that was the gamble
 That was the risk
" And that's the thing that frightens people, they love the concept of working like this"
 And the additional accidental benefit that you don't ever end up with staff vacancies
" I mean, we we have a waiting list for GPS, nurses, secretaries, receptionists, which I never really expected to happen, because they like the what this way of working"
" Yeah, what to come and work with us"
" And that's great, because there's an awful lot of unfilled clinical posts in the community"
" Yeah, you know, lots lots of GPS missing, and nurses, and we don't have that problem"
" So it's, it's a really good model for that, in that respect"
 You don't got to worry about when someone retires
" Yeah, but you've just got to take on the financial risk"
 That's the problem
Yeah I mean east kent is no exception
" In fact, we know we have a large number of GP and other allied health, personal places, vacancies unfilled"
" But you know, it's slightly embarrassing that people will always want to come work with us"
" So it's, it's very nice side effect"
"Yeah, I mean, I'm I have been for quite a long time a GP surgeon"
 I've now become less than full time and I do local steroid injection clinics
So I i complement our physiotherapists
" You know, we we work together on musculoskeletal problems"
" And that's nice for me, but others of my colleagues, our GP, dermatologists, dp diabetologist"
 And GP surgeons
 One we had one GP was an herbal epilepsy specialist
" And in the UTC our lead nurse, or ACP, she's call you know, acute care practitioner"
" She's done a master's degree in thromboembolism, and she runs the DVT service with help from a visiting consulting mythologist"
" And, to be honest, she knows more than the GPS"
" So it's very good, you know,"
"Okay, well nice to speak to you, Rachel and if you do come to Kent, may see you in person as well"
