So how are you keeping Mohsin
Not bad
 How are you
Where are you based at the moment
Fair enough big patch
correct
 Yes
"she had lead pharmacists for high cost drugs, Home Care medical transition and formulary"
"Yes, that's one of the things in my portfolio Yes"
"Yeah, absolutely"
" I think first wave was everyone was really motivated to help, you know, we're gonna come together and things are quite well, but the NHS service no longer existed in the first wave"
 It was just a children
 COVID service
 Yeah
" So we stopped all outpatient activity, active surgery"
 It was Yeah
" So we were purely focused, and everyone was driven and, you know, the population, the people, they really adhere to the lockdown initially"
" Okay, second wave has been disastrous, in my opinion, is really have been bad"
" So, you know, people haven't been taken seriously"
 So we've had massive spikes
" We had to add a trust, maintainn our patient services, elective surgery, which again, was a challenge"
 Yeah
 Because you just got reduced capacity
" And then in terms of the workforce, which was the biggest thing for me"
 Yeah
 People lost the motivation and emotion was gone
We had colleagues pretty severely air colleagues passing away
" Yeah, children at school, other schools close now"
 It was just an absolute mess
" And it's just, it still is really difficult at work"
" You know, we can't decide our roter until nine o'clock in the morning because we every day, we know something's gonna happen"
"So I manage a team I, I no longer see, or I, I'm not involved in direct patient care anymore"
" Okay, right"
" Unless I'm covering for somebody, which has been quite regularly recently, but generally not on the wards not seeing patients in clinics, etc"
 Even though I'm a non medical prescriber
" I don't, I don't I don't see patients anymore"
" So what I'm involved is mainly project work formulary work guidelines, and then managing services and managing parts of our home care, home care service"
" Okay, having conversations with our commissioners around, you know, STP work ICS work, Formulary, what's going on primary care what's going on secondary care"
 It's it's quite wide ranging
So it depends on different pathways
" So see if there's a NICE advice on, we have no choice"
 We have to get it onto the formulary
 Yeah
 We'll talk about patients
" Yeah, well, we have more than one option to put up within DOACs, you know, your license for AF"
" You know, we have that conversation with our clinicians"
" Okay, we have conversations with yourself with your MSL potentially, with the evidence"
" But especially within the doac carrier, I find like the I mean, the evidence, it is what it is, but it's not head to head, it's never going to be you can't compare the data for revenue expenditure"
" So you're looking at safety, but from my experience, I let our clinicians dictate what they want and their real life experience Trumps all the data that you can present to them"
" Yeah, and they have extensive experience"
" You know, I remember the days where we just had to pick a trend and then as you know, rivaroxaban came and then apixaban came and then now we've got adoxaban as well"
" Yeah, they all have different profiles, you know, different patients are suitable for different things"
" I'll give you an example of my own my own father, although he's taking it for prophylaxis of DVT"
" Apixaban was chosen for him, but actually in Ramadan, when he's fasting for 15 hours of the day"
" Yeah, it's the apixaban work for him"
" So we change him over to rivaroxaban for that whole month, so again different patient to do things"
" So essentially, the guideline, the policy formula decisions are dictated by the clinicians"
 Yeah
"And then in terms of what input I would have, is actually speaking to our primary care clinics, actually, a few guys are going to continue this, what's your opinion"
 What do you want to say
 Okay
" And then I will do the cost analysis with the commission and see what's, what's the burden gonna be, you know, we might be might have a discounted price for initiating patients, but then if it's a higher cost in primary care, because we're looking more closely together now, we haven't have those conversations"
Yeah
" So again, just to add there, so in our trust trust policy, is that doxapan is first line"
" Okay, but that doesn't mean that we will not allow patients to have something else if the clinician deems it appropriate"
 Yeah
" And I was really, you know, I was the commissioners didn't agree with that"
 I was really adamant that that was going to be the case
 Yeah
So okay
 It's a balancing act
 Yeah
" So,"
"For me, it's all about education"
 Right
" So you know, initially when we have a conversation, and let's just say apixaban is new drug, you're going to give me what information I need"
 You're going to give me data
 Yeah
" You can potentially arrange me to speak to you MSL you're gonna what really interests me is evidence, new evidence, new licenses, which you know, all the ducks have been going through new licenses"
 Yeah
 Holding educational sessions for my junior pharmacists
" Okay, you'll get an up to speed"
" So we have something in our trust to use before COVID came twice weekly lunchtime education sessions, where we gave a 20 minute slot to pharma"
" Yeah, got it"
 Yeah
" And they bought three food, which is always helpful"
 Yeah
 Yeah
" And then the rest of the 40 minutes, we don't have conversation about what we just described without the agenda"
 So we used to do that certification in that sense
" But I think the secondary thing that's come about after COVID is, you know, using experts within the NHS to teach with the colleagues in the NHS, so hosting seminars, seminars, afterwork seminars online, where you know, an expert in doacs or hematology somewhere"
" Yeah, you guys would procure for them to develop for, you know, an educational topic"
Sounds quite interesting and that It's quite useful actually
It's more the management of that process
" So a high cost drug will have a nice technology appraisal, or it's gonna have an NHS England specialist commissioning policy document, which means that we can use it"
" Yeah, then it's just a case of, you know, having a procurer with prices and gears, who's going to supply it because actually, the trustworthy suppliers can go buy a home care or maybe not patient is it bundled or unbundled the homecare offering the PSP, then there's the management of high cost drugs"
" So remember, the commissioners are paying for these drugs"
" So on that cost, they want the assurance that the right patients are getting these drugs that might involve new tech or might involve audit work might involve engagement clinical teams, and then in the back of that you've got biosimilars coming out"
" Now, let's switch to patient that's a whole consenting process, the management of that, okay, it's quite, it's not the fact that we're putting down to the formulary or the decision process of putting in the formulary, it's more the whole management around that"
" But then on top of that, what also, what time takes is kind of deciding where it's going to fall in the pathway looks patients, right, okay"
" They know, 10 options for the same indication, you have to offer them more legally"
" But actually, we can't give everyone access to everything"
 So we have an algorithm where the cost effectiveness content
"So high cost durgs, commissioning economy is synonymous, but we also look at some of the contracts for the services that we have"
So I get some input in that
 And then some of the conditions
" For example, an ophthalmologist wants to, you know, deliver a new clinic for AMD, then I would be supporting him and discussing that with the commissioners, and the commissioners in NHS England"
" essentially, what the service what quite what requirements how do we do it into the population, just to put the impact analysis, that kind of stuff"
So quite broad
The job description is as brief as you can get
 I think I've just kind of spread my wings a little bit
 Too much
"Yeah, it was it wasn't because I'm an insomniac"
 It kind of works quite well
"yeah, yeah"
 So we will detail as to factory
" I don't know, I don't look at initial trials and phase two, phase three, but you have to enter some new drug but I'm not really that interested in that data"
 What I'm interested in is real life will be worth data
" And that's where I think you got the differentiation and safety profiles and efficacy in different demographics, you get an idea"
" Yeah, it's just so yeah, it's just so useful"
 And it gives you a massive insight into the decisions that you're making
" Absolutely, yeah,"
"Yeah, absolutely"
 Independent data is pretty good
" The issue is, we look at you and the data that you present with us as we treat like the enemy"
" I don't know why it is just, it's just built into us"
" We'll go, you can't necessarily sell the drug to us, of course, you want to present it in the best way"
 Absolutely
 Yeah
" It's just, this seems to be this kind of obstacle in believing"
I agree
 I think
 I think it expands great
 I think my dad takes it for example
" Yeah, agreed"
 They're just they're just this perception of negativity towards any data that's given to us in that way
it is it is unfortunate
" And it's something that we're taught as undergraduates, you know, how to critically appraise data that's presented to you"
" Yeah, it builds into your mind this idea that actually everything is just a means of false promotion"
" But I think to an extent, I I don't disagree with them"
 Yeah
" If you are, you know, competent in interpreting that data, and you spent time around people, you know, how to critically appraise it"
" Yeah, you can you get the gist of what's going on"
 Absolutely
yeah
 I think the one thing that really is a pet hate of mine is when you have a slide with apixabans data showing the efficacy
 Yeah
 And the slide that follows that we'll have one of your competitors data
" Yeah, I will say you can't make a direct comparison, because a BPO, wont allow you yours just not allowed to do that"
" Doesn't imply comparison, but actually been understood is an entirely different population is there's so many different factors to take into consideration"
" Yeah, it's a personal pet hate of mine"
yeah
 I'm sure I'm sure we can debate this all day
"hopefully, the weather is a bit brighter in your mind, because,"
Yeah
 Okay
 Anthony Pleasure as always
Thank you much
 All right
 Bye
 Bye
 Bye
