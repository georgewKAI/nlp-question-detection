"Hillary, thank you so much"
 I'm just going to click this button
 It just says that I'm the host for the meeting
" Thank you, it's been a pleasure to have this opportunity to catch up with you just to let me remind you, I'm sure you've heard this a million times today it is being recorded for training purposes, but I've been told that I need to say that just to kind of kick the presentation off"
 How are you are you alright
So we're in tier two
" So to be honest, it's a good way to reflect and keep your distance from everyone and just when Christmas comes, and we're allowed to mingle a bit freely, I'm so looking forward to it"
 I'm sure you're probably the same
" Yeah, have you done, Have you done any of your Christmas shopping yet"
 Or you're gonna wait to
I'm with you absolutely
"Oh I've not heard of, Funny I know, there's not on the high street"
com which we tend to buy a little bit from and they're lovely and bespoke
" But no, I'm gonna have a look at that one actually not on, I' actually going to jot that down"
" Because, like you said, it's so important to support our local businesses, then the big ones are going to thrive, but the little ones are all going to go under"
 And they're under so much pressure right now as well
 Not on Amazon
" I don't know who came up with that name, but I love it"
 Not on everything
 Not on Amazon
 Did you say sorry
Yeah
 Love it
 Love it
 Fabulous
 Fantastic
 So I'm definitely going to be looking out for that
" Hillary, I'm gonna keep an eye on the time, because I've been told I've got to keep a strict eye on the time, because I know that you've got other commitments to get to get to as well"
 So I'll be respectful of that
" And so in tier three, does that mean that you can't mingle with anybody"
 Or is it shut down after 10
 Or
"Oh my god, so its you know, oh that's terrible"
 But you got to look at the bigger picture
" I know, it's, it's not great for people that are being isolated and individuals that are being isolated that are on their own, but it's for the greater good"
" And I guess, having that in the background makes it just a little bit acceptable"
 And just understanding a little bit more
That will be amazing thatll be so nice
 And then our fingers crossed and go back to what was always been normal for us
" And it's been so so hard to I guess COVID is still having quite a strong presence where you are, and How does, how does that kind of impact the way that you work"
 And has it had an impact in your role
"For every every industry, I think, has adopted the digital environment is the only way to be at the moment because we've lost that face to face personal interaction that we used to have and we take for granted"
" It's really interesting that your role is sorry, I've just jotted down a few things"
" You're not your role is very unique, because you've got the Federation on one side, one side of it, you've got the PCN kind of on another side, how do they, I mean, do do the parties always marry up with a completely different to one another"
absolutely
Oh Wow
"And Hillary, can I ask you, did you say is the Federation that icon that are of the Federation, could you can kind of take responsibility and do what it is that they want"
 Are they the one that served the wafarin services being kind of looked at with the Federation and not with the PCN
Yeah
 Are you finding that with with the the wafarin killing that scene contracted at the moment
" Are you finding it difficult for patients to do their own arms because of, you know, lack of interaction and coming to the six surgeries to kind of have their own arm checks"
Sure
 So Hillary so I'm not sure if you're aware of the role that Pfizer play
" So I work with Pfizer, I work with primary care"
" We work with PCN, we promote apixaban"
" And I guess where that would kind of I mean, how did you see yourselves being part of the part of the Federation, but equally being a PCN management lead"
 How do how does it work
 How do you see yourselves working with with the pharma industry
Okay
 Yeah
"Yeah, it's a shame because some people have moved on, and some haven't"
" And, like you said, We are governed so strongly around the ABCs of what we can do and what we can't do"
" And ultimately, our our long, long term goal is to save as many patients as we can"
" And we're not saying that, you know, our drug is the best for absolutely everybody, because that's not the case"
 That's not real life
" But what we do is we offer a solution to those patients that need a medication that has the evidence, and it's superior over others, or it can show less bleeding profile, to give you those options, and the variety of medication that is out there, where it kind of fits into your prescribing"
" And, you know, I know that you said the long term plan is slightly different"
" I mean, that the PCM plan, sorry, let me get myself mixed up"
" So you were saying that,"
"sorry, I've got so many notes, I've been jotting down because it was so much I want to try and cover off"
" And obviously in real life, that doesn't happen, because there's so much information that comes up from just having a conversation"
" So I guess with the with your, your PCN management hat on"
" Does that, does that change with the NHS long term plan"
 Or are the goals aligned
Yeah what is the main focus
"Sure, sure"
" And just coming back to your point around, you know, pharma and and PCN's and kind of working for forward and and by the sounds not engaging with with the pharma industry"
" We have so many resources available and it doesn't mean that you know, you have to take our product because we you know, we've helped, you know, identify some resources that are available for training or so forth"
" We do I mean, it varies where you go the the impact and the relationship that the pharma has with PCN's, luckily, fingers crossed, where I work, we have great relationship with PCN's"
" And ofcourse its not just a what's our agenda and it's not, you know, signing a partnership or how we can support one another"
" So, you know, if those opportunities do arise that an Pfizer can support, especially with identifying some of those out of range patients and what to do with them, if they can't, if they need to be switched to a diet, how do you choose which one is really supporting you with the education and, and the support that we have available"
" Just coming back to something which I read about yourself, I'd want to do soon"
 It's true
" I read something that really did amaze me about this amazing company, which you set up, which you set up, I don't know how you've managed to do that, while holding down various hats"
" In your various roles, called Pet Mix"
 I had a sneaky little peek on the internet to cos i have
" My lovely physiotherapist who we've got such a fantastic relationship with and she's got a couple of dogs, and that she would love some of those beats"
 And her little her little Maisie her dog has currently been having some seizures
" And she's been to the vet, to and fro"
" And I just thought it's probably gonna be the last time I see her this year, next week, maybe I could have a look and see what little parting gift I could give her because she's so so lovely"
 So tell me a little bit about your business
 I was so intrigued when I thought I couldn't believe
Ah your shutting it down
I can Imagine
"Oh, yeah, yeah,"
"Hey, I bought something like that was my first one was born"
 It was a little different from mums and toddlers
"And all he did was it wasn't like sticky wet clay, you just put your hand in it and it came out clean wet wiped it down"
 And I've got his fingerprints for life
 And he was a little baby because they've doubled in size and tripled in size
" But what a lovely idea, I saw that I saw some of the images that you had on on the website, and I just pulled how very professional the website was"
 It was it was it was difficult initially to find a website because I was reading and then then I clicked into I think it was wolf last
com
 And then that took me somewhere else
 And then I went finally got into the website
" And that's what a lovely, really well made website and hats off to you"
 What's managing your jobs and the wealth of experience you've got behind you
 And how many years of service I think it was 30 years and a trainer in the sector and still manage to set up your own business
 on the sideline
 I thought I don't know how you do it and made me moaning about my three kids and doing the school run and coming home and cleaning up and doing my jobs
Has it always been your passion to have your own business or was it something that you kind of thought of with with some quiet time during lockdown and thought what could I do and
Well hats off to you for doing such an amazing job
 And I wouldn't say I wouldn't give up now because now it would be a really good time
" But people are looking for personalized gifts, especially if you can't see relatives and friends and family"
" And yes, I know, there's a lot of people out there doing their personalized bits and bobs"
" But you know what, I think there's a need, there's a niche for yours, because they're different in the sense that you've actually got physically a poor print on the candle, which you can't find anywhere else"
 I haven't seen that anywhere else
 But you've done the hardest job is setting it up
" You know, if you could advertise here and there to get the word, you know, spread out to people to"
Isnt that exciting
 I don't know how they're gonna mobilize that
" And, you know, there's so much speculation and everyone's just so grateful that there is a vaccine"
" And the next question is, how did they"
 Do they give it to health care workers first
 Do they give it to the elderly in the care home
 How are they going to distribute it and keep it within that temperature and ensure that the two doses are done within the timeframe
" It's just so many questions, and I'm sure that you know, as a PCN, that, you know, fingers crossed that once they decide how it's going to be how it's going to be mobilized that this makes it sit with yourselves as to add the pcn who and how this is going to be"
"yeah, I bet"
 I bet
" I mean, could you imagine if they asked the hospitals to start initiating, I mean, I thought the whole purpose was to keep people away from the hospitals and the NHS staff were inundated with the amount of patients that are coming through, this is just going to increase the workload isnt it"
So how exciting What a perfect Christmas gift
 One of the things you would never of asked for it
 The things that you would least expect will be the most gracious gift that we're going to receive
 And that is the fact of going out and just meeting everyone and just doing normal things that we tend to take for granted
" So I'm, I can't wait, I really can't just hope that this this gets rolled out to protect as many cuz we've lost so many lives, and put so many people's lives at risk"
 And it would be nice for us to just have a normal a normal Christmas and a normal life
 That would that would be amazing
" Hilary, thank you so much for your time"
 I know
 It was such a pleasure to hear about your business
 Do not give up
"Oh, you're so sweet"
 You don't have to do that
" But it was just a pleasure to see you open up when you talk about your project your baby, you know, and very few can say that they've had a chance and they've they've gave it a run and they're going to see where it goes"
 So well all done and hats off to you
 And thank you for everything that you do
 If I don't catch you before Christmas Have a fantastic Christmas
 Good luck with the job that you do and take care of yourself
Lovely to meet you
 Take care
