"Hey, how you doing"
"Yeah, good"
 So you're okay with me calling you Mohsin
 Pronouncing it correctly
"Yeah, Mohsin, well look"
" Firstly, let me introduce myself"
 Okay
 So I'm Raj Raj Virdee
 I've been with Pfizer now for about 15 16 years
" And I've worked Kent and secondary care in Kent, with a barrage with a variety of products, you know, over that period, so I've never worked anywhere else but I've covered all the hosptial processing in Kent"
 With a slight caveat with Apixaban
 Why
" Because we're co promoting with BMS, I share cap with another colleague, but I've gone from working Devon hospitals with a respiratory portfolio two years ago to three now, which is um, well, I'm not as busy as I used to be"
" Let me say that, so"
" So yeah, so I've got a wealth of experience"
" And, you know, in various different areas, and I've been with Pfizer for for quite some time now, so"
" And, and yourself, what's your background"
 And
Dont point that- I don't need a reminder of how old I am
"Wow, did you mentioned about stroke"
 The line broke up there a little bit
 Was that me
So I just need to point out that I'm the VTE specialist
" You know, that's my remit with regard to the day job, etc"
" I mean, look with this whole COVID situation, how are things where you are"
 Because we're in tier three down here in the south
"Yes, I've caught up with some of your coll your colleagues down here and it was quite disheartening, really because they were telling they were saying, I was speaking to a respiratory specialist that I've worked with over the years and he was just saying that this second wave is worse than the first one, down in Margate in particular where we are I think, you know where I am in Medway, sort of mid Kent, we're approaching 600 per 100,000 patients infection rate so it's gone crazy"
" My kids schools have closed down, the schools have all closed down because of infections within their bubbles, teachers students"
 So it's um it's rather scary you know
" And I really feel for you know, you and your colleagues and what you're done for- thank you as well you know, you know, haven't got a chance to thank my my customers, NHS staff, you know, that I work with for all they've done and thank you guys for what you're doing"
 I know
" It's been I would say almost borderline traumatic this year, to be honest"
" You know many ways so I really feel for you guys and hopefully you know hopefully there's some light at the tunnel hopefully, we'll get through it and you know, some normality will return for all of us"
" But yeah, really appreciate all your efforts"
 So thanks for that update
 Your surname was well stood out to me when I saw it
 You don't have any family members down south do you
Really
"Yeah, yeah, I get it, yeah yeah yeah true"
 True
 True
 True
" No, I just I saw your surname I thought but so Mohsin is, firstly I've got a geriatrician that I used to work with, but he's probably retired now, Mohsin"
" I've got another geriatrician colleague customer that works over in Dartford and he he's got the same surname as you and i thought oh my goodness, maybe it might be him but obviously I saw your remit was and obviously not and you're obviously much, much younger, but much younger"
" But look you know, from my point of view, just to move the discussion over a little bit, I haven't, I've got to be honest, you know, I, with all these 15 years of experience I've got, you know, I know a lot of the consultants that I work with, you know, in the specialist areas that I promote into, but pharmacy has always been a department that I've struggled with a little bit to engage with"
" And I think it's really interesting, because I'll give you give you a bit of an anecdote, one of the areas I used to work, Dartford, at Darant Valley Hospital, I used to have, you know, very good access and relationships with, you know, your pharmacy colleagues there all of a sudden, overnight"
" It was like, we're not seeing any industry"
" And so I've struggled to kind of engage with, you know, some of your colleagues, personally, across Kent, and I feel it's almost easier to see my consultanty and this pharmacy, and they seem to be a bit guarded"
" So I guess, from my point of view, what would be really useful for me, would be to maybe get some of your insights around your priority as a, as a pharmacist within it within a trust your priorities"
" I know your roles vary, obviously"
 But there may be some similarities in what you want from a working relationship industry
" For example, if someone like me, it'd be really good to get your insights around some of the priorities maybe now in the current situation, but you know, figure out, you know, both for BTE and education, what the kind of things you you've liked about working with industry, what the things you want more of"
" That kind of stuff, really"
I get it
"Yeah, I get that"
"So, okay, okay"
 Okay
 You've said something there that's made my light up
" So, traditionally, with education, for example, okay, we we do we do that we do the promotional bit, if you like, I guess my approach has always been, and I think it's sometimes froze"
" I think the expectation from you know, what, that you're the audience, I'm coming in the expectation that I'm going to tell you my drug is the best thing since sliced bread"
" I guess my attack has always been about my you know, I'm here not not not to promote my drug is the best thing since sliced bread, but, but to maybe help facilitate and educate"
" I kind of say what it was in my head there, but informed discussion around best treatment for the patient, you know, whether that's in a multidisciplinary scenario, or whether you know, the patient that's what, that's my mindset when I go in to presenting so I'm, that's that's my approach, and that's the way it's been for however long I've been in this industry"
 So I really appreciate your feedback
" And I think that Yeah, I need to I think some of the sessional stuff is probably probably exists in some of my accounts"
 I think it's kind of gone from being there to not being there
" Like I mentioned the Dartford account, I think they probably had a bad experience with pharma, decided to close the doors, which has affected all of us, which is a shame"
" I totally understand you know, the bad farmer perception and you know"
Right
" Oh, this is so"
 Yeah
 Okay
" It's interesting, you mentioned also that from from it from, from the point of university, you're kind of, you've had this kind of instilled in you that, you know, the bad part is really interesting, because when you speak to the junior doctors, I mean, I found that a few years ago that they kind of avoid you know, because they've had that kind of, you know what, don't take lunch from- it was against policy, we were told not to do this or not to listen"
" So, it just seems that things haven't moved forward"
" And I think I think most of most of the people like myself and my colleagues, we understand their perception, I think Pfizer's trying to do best on a global level to kind of change that perception"
" And, you know, I represent Pfizer, Pfizer locally"
 And I don't want that perception
" For me, I've said this many times, you know I, you can do your job without me"
" You know, I can't do my job without you and your colleagues, I really can't"
 So I've always got that in my mind
" And I'm always keen to discuss the local challenges, within my account, understand what they are"
" And then if I can help with something great if I can't, I'll ask, and you know, I'll try and get that support or do some irrelevant, and you mentioned something really interesting"
" So I've talked a lot, we've only got five minutes left"
" But one last thing I wanted to get your take on is that historically with education, yes, we can deliver education, you mentioned MSL is our internal medics non commercial can come and deliver education"
" And historically, we've mobilized specialists to deliver education"
" But you mentioned some interesting, you know"
" I guess what we're trying to do now, the approach is trying to get relevant peer groups to present to their peers"
" So pharma's will be one group that I've never had that pharmacist, and it's, for me, I want to personally, I want to move towards developing someone like yourself or a colleague, to be able to present relevant information about a disease area and the challenges that sit within that disease area to their colleagues"
" I think, you know, that with this virtual platform, where we can we can, you know, that that could be national, for example right"
 It doesn't have to be someone local
 But I think that's something I'm going to try
Wow
 Okay
" So, okay, that's something that I'm going to feed back to my wider team"
" We've got a couple of minutes, a few minutes left, I've talked a lot, you've given me a load of information, sorry, it's a bit selfish"
 You haven't done much to help this bad pharma kind of image
" But with regard to you, yourself, you know, is there anything you want to ask me"
 Is there anything that you know
" And I'm not your local representative, but is there anything you want to talk about my role, the industry, you know anything like that"
Okay
 Okay
 Crikey
" I've learned so much, I think, you know what there's, what I would say is here you know, quite often with us, guys, we, you know, we have framed on that training in the commercial promotional science competitive data"
" And what we probably really need as a the part of our training or to help facilitate our training is more people like yourself coming and delivering these insights to to us, and this used to happen many years ago"
" And it's kind of changed we've moved away from it, but I really do think that we need to revisit and bring people like yourself in to come and help educators around these you've share with me today"
Have you have you been involved in delivering any of this kind of education then
You've got kids as well
"Ah brilliant, how old is he"
"You know what, I think you're right, and I can tell you my oldest in particularly"
" My, my son, is 12"
 My youngest is seven
" And I would say to you, you know, work work is important Of course, it is"
" But this time, you know, it's really, I look back at videos of my sixteen year old, and you're like, geez, you know"
"Yeah, it was such an amazing time"
" One of the things I'm grateful for with the roll I do, is that there is a degree of flexibility in the working day, right"
"And the Pfizer's very keen to push that kind of flexible working, which is fantastic"
" Because you know, what, I'm a hands on dad, my wife works for a local authority"
" She's an accountant, and her job is very much nine to five, you know, longer hours even"
" So, I've been lucky to be able to be around help with, you know, picking up the kids, you know, you know, having I feel blessed in that regard, but I would say to you is a slightly older, sort of, give it a slightly older insight"
" We have three kids, it's the best time and this is the two years old"
" They that's when they're chubby and cute, right"
"Through this lockdown time, we've been going through our videos and you can you know, everyone's laughing out loud oh I can't believe you know, you looked like that"
" And or you used to do that, you know, stupid things that my son"
 What did he- he couldn't say we used to think Pirates of the Caribbean was one of the movies he used to watch when he was like four or five years old
 He couldn't say Pirates of the Caribbean
 Caravin
 We're watching a video of him doing that
" So it's little things like that, that"
 Oh my god
 It's it's amazing
"Yeah, I think so"
" I'm gonna, the other thing I was gonna ask you is, if it's okay, maybe I'll check with my colleague who was just on but maybe some email contact between us"
I am on LinkedIn
" Yeah, Raj Virdee"
 R A J V I R D E E
Yeah
" And then potentially, you know what you've given me we're going into my business planning phase going forward"
"No, if I were I'd have like an E63 AMG or something on the drive, GT, no, no, but you've mentioned that I'm gonna contact them because as you know, with sir names"
 Is that Verdee
 Is he a Virdee
That was taken
 There's that's taken at my brother's wedding about eight years ago
" Trust me, I'm I haven't had a haircut for 9 months, I'm wearing a headband"
 I put on a bit of weight
" Yeah, so that time, I've got chronic back problem and in that time, in the run up to my brother's wedding, I've been playing badminton, I love it"
 And I've been doing a lot of exercise
" Just, I got to a point where I put on a bit of weight, you know, I just decided, look, I wanna be fit healthy for the kids"
 Right
 So I started playing badminton during an acute episode with my back
" And shortly after that, if I tell you how it happened, you have no sympathy for me"
 It's not entirely my fault
 My brother's wedding reception
" I'm not a big guy, but he wanted me to put him on my shoulder, right"
"Punjabi wedding, right"
" And I said look mate, you weigh more than me your, I can't do that"
" And he said, your your not on your own, and I'll get I'll get the other chap to help"
 Did that
" And I knew that moment, something's happened I'm going to pay for this"
 The next day in the shower
" I you know, got out of the shower, and I bent down to kind of I was drying myself down"
 I couldn't get back up
 All I could do 2was fall to the floor I was in so much pain
 And it took 45 minutes for someone to I was screaming
 No no one found me
" That you know, no one heard me they came in I think my brother thought I was dying or something"
" So we're all together in the family house the day after the wedding, right"
" And the ambulance came out and they couldn't move me so it got to a point, it was a bit bit of a calamity of errors because the ambulance when they came out that look we got to get you to a bed and going to give you a thing you know gas and air that will help with the pain but they brought the wrong attachment and couldn't, so literally I just said look, I just need to get up"
" They got me up, I just threw my just threw myself on the bed but I had like, three or four days laid up"
" It probably took me a few weeks to put, but away but long story short, I've never done this much exercise maybe you know, not what it was since I've put on a bit of weight and"
"Terrible, terrible stuff"
" You know, you know, it's interesting"
 I used to sell Lyrica right
" And all the memories of talking to my customers about chronic pain, come back and was like oh, my God"
" It's happening to me, you know, but there we go"
" But yeah, it's been a pleasure to talk to you"
I don't know how this is going to end I thought was a 15 minute conversation
 We've got it penciled in for half an hour here
"Oh, right"
" Okay, sorry"
" So I've got Sorry, I was sorry"
 15 minutes
 I've got confused
 So I brought the conversation to an end too early
Am I allowed to just end it
 I don't even know
Really
" Okay well, you know what"
 I'll add you on LinkedIn
 And it'd be it'd be nice to catch up with you
" Just to thank you on every, all the insights you've given me and I hope it's been some value to you as well patting"
 It's always nice to meet new people
"I'll keep in touch and all the best, stay safe"
"Give my best all your colleagues and you know, I know morale's low but you know, you know, thank you and chin up"
Bye bye
