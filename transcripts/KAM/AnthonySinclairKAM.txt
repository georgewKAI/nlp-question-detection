 Home Care
"Oh, I see"
 Okay
 Okay
" Um, Mohsin How, how have COVID"
 How has it affected
 Your colleagues and so on within the hospital
" Because it's been quite devastating, obviously, around the UK"
I see
 Okay
" Yeah, yeah"
 Yeah
 Yeah
" You guys are doing a brilliant job, but it is"
 So it's such a strange thing
" I never ever, ever thought in my lifetime, I would obviously lived through a pandemic, you know what I mean"
" And so, it is, you know, it's so uprooted everything I would imagine, you know, so it's good that you and your colleagues are doing okay, but, you know, I'm hoping I'm really hoping that it comes to an end sooner rather than later"
" So, honestly, definitely, so Mohsin and tell me a little bit more of your role"
 So is it more do you see patients or do you manage a group of pharmacists
"Okay, okay"
 Yeah
 So I cover Yes
" So, within the hospital, and I see a lot of and I cover apixaban for atrial fibrillation"
 I also do another drug for amyloid cardiomyopathy
" You know, and so, please, how does, how do you in terms of formulary decision"
 How does you got How do you guys decide what gets into the formula and so on
"Sure, sure"
 Okay
 Yeah
 And you're absolutely right
 It's about finding the right medicines for the right patients
 And it's all about the patient
" You know, so we do focus a lot on what's best for the patient, so to speak, you know"
"so Mohsin, when you see representatives as myself"
" What is it that you you look for what is it they, What type of information"
" Or you know, what type of, for instance, support can we give you in order to get the best out of our service"
Yeah
 Yeah
" Because and you're absolutely right, we do do a lot of that in terms of providing education"
" It could be, you can meet and bring in, it could be a consultant within your trust, or whatever, to give a talk around a certain specific area, just interest of interest to you guys, you know what I mean"
" And so, um, there's a, there's another thing that we have, also, that you may find interesting, and it's, it's a, it's a site that we have, and it's strictly for healthcare professionals"
 It's called Pfizer Pro
" And so if you have to go with the air register, put in the information and put in a create a password and everything on there Mohsin, what you'll find, there's a lot of information around all Pfizer medicines, and vaccines is a lot of information also gives you you can actually, now you can speak directly with a representative or even put information in there, and a representative will come back to you and get you the right information that you may require"
 It could be around any drug or whatever
" Also, there's a lot of patient information in there"
" So free stuff for patients, but you can find some information on there for patients"
" And also a lot of materials, educational materials"
" For instance, if you wanted to sign up or register for a Pfizer meeting that's coming up, it could be a month or two away"
" And here, your team even attend to those meetings"
 They're quite good
" And even videos, there are videos on there that you can print"
 You want lunch meetings within with your team around a certain area
" So these are peer to peer Expert videos that are on the site that you can actually, you know, run with you even so on"
 So it's quite good actually
"Yeah, yeah, definitely"
" It's, it's called you could go there is Pfizer Pro, is Pfizer Pro"
 Co
uk
 So you can always go there and sign up and register
" And, you know, it will ask you, if you're a healthcare professional initially, when you go into the site, you say yes"
" And then in the right hand corner, there's information, you just register with the site"
 Good
 Yeah
" Yeah, definitely"
 Definitely
" So, um, so what what other type of Do you mostly focus because I was looking at some information on the pharmaceutical journal, and he says, is the most the high cost medicines that you focus on"
Corret Yeah
 Yeah
" So my, when I first first qualified when I did my prescribing course, I did it on"
 anticoagulation AF
 Yeah
" And now that since developed now, I'm supposed to be an expert in biologics and most of my life, but all of it higher cost drugs"
 So my portfolio is mainly high cost drugs and psychology appraisals and NICE and that kind of stuff
"Okay, okay"
 Okay
" So, um, so, in terms of my construct, so you make a decision in terms of a higher cost drug comes down to the, within the system within, within the formulary"
"Yeah, yeah"
 Okay
" So and also you do, you do a little bit of commissioning, also, from from what I read"
 So that involves a lot within your workload
"Okay, okay"
"job description, isn't it"
Okay
 Okay
" So that I would imagine it keeps you very busy, though"
 I would imagine
 Yeah
I can imagine
 Yeah
 Okay
" So, um, so, yeah, but like you said, Now, you don't really see a lot of patients"
" So, you know, but then obviously, you do influence your team"
 So a lot of your team members will go that to that level
 See all our patients on our I would imagine
" Yeah, yeah, correct"
 Okay
 Okay
" So, so, yeah, um, in regards to Yeah, as I mentioned, in terms of anticoagulation, or apixaban for AF, you know, like said, there's no head to head date or anything like that"
" But we also have a lot of an excellent reward data for apixaban, which is, you know, which would be quite useful, you know, for you and your team in order to, you know, to know, you know, when presenting or deciding on what to use for the patients and so on, you know,"
"absolutely, you definitely see exactly how the drug is, you know, randomized control trials are very good"
" But the reward data will give you a real life experience in terms of what's going on, and and how effective the drug is, and how the patients are responding to that drug, also, and also, a lot of it is quite independently"
 So you have a lot of independence in regards to some data on your data
" So I would imagine, it would be quite useful"
"I've spoken to people and they've said to me in the past, you guys pick the best of your data, and show it to me"
"So they think we're, you know, we pick the best of everything, and just pick out the cherry picking a lot of ways, which we don't we pretty much put everything out there"
" You know, when showing the data, and by then that's where real data comes in"
" And it you know, because every you know, a lot of it is peer reviewed"
 So it's for apixaban
" It's really, really, really good"
Yeah
 which is unfortunate
" You know,"
"Yeah, absolutely"
 Yeah
 Yeah
" And there's different forms, obviously, of data to look at and interpret"
 And so you're absolutely right
" And, you know, and there are some people that do cherry pick certain things, do you mean that so you have to be able to see you again, get a good idea"
" And he and struck a palace in regards to, um, you know, what was the real outcome i would say"
"I think in a lot of ways, to right"
" It's their data we have, it's kind of like we're showing what their data is saying, as opposed to, it's not us saying that we just showing what they're indeed, their own data showing"
" And we're just comparing it to ours and to say, what our data showing you know what i mean"
 So as opposed to us being one sided
 And just showing everything that we have on our side You know what i mean
 And I think that's more or less it
 I would say
" Yeah,"
Mohsin
 Thank you very much
 Let's
" Yeah,"
"unfortunately, not it's not"
 I think it's supposed to rain all weekend too
 So I don't think it's gonna get any better than it is right now
" You know, looking forward to the spring day"
pleasure
" Mine also listen, you and your staff"
 Keep safe
 Okay
