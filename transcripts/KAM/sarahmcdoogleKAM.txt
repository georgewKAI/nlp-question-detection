QUERY
Good morning
Hi
" And well I guess just before I start to and I introduce myself, I would just like to take this opportunity firstly to thank you, and and your colleagues for the outstanding work that you've done throughout the pandemic"
" It's been a very challenging year this year, and I'm sure it has been for yourself in the job that you do"
" And so I'll just introduce myself, so you know who I am"
" So I'm Sarah and, and I've worked for Pfizer for 20 years now in various different roles, but most recently, in secondary care, covering anticoagulation, as a VTE specialist"
" And we can probably tell from my accent that I work up in the northeast of England, so Newcastle area, and I guess I was asked to be part of this research, to help to understand how to better engage clinicians like yourselves over a virtual platform"
 And so I guess the majority of what we do now is delivered virtually hence the importance of trying to get it right and make the experience work for both me both ourselves and yourself
 And so it would be really good to understand a little bit more about you about your role and how your time split between research and clinical duties and how you've managed this year and how you've been impacted by a Covid
 So be really good just to get a little bit of insight about yourself
"Hows that felt because that's a big change, isn't it"
Well thats positive and a good step forward
 Yeah
" I'm actually quite intrigued when I was having a look at role profile, and I wasn't sure how applicable it was going to be to talk to you about VTE, I wasn't sure how often you would come across and pass patients with DVT or PE"
" But I'm quite, I'm quite pleasantly surprised that you have such a role that you've had"
 When did you hand over the reins
"Oh, that's brilliant"
 It's brilliant
" So I presume that will be good to understand what um, what your what your VTE protocol looks like"
" Have you had an opportunity to review the recently published by BT guidance, whichever became, it's probably a really bad time in March of this year"
 It would be interesting to understand what your protocol currently look like in terms of managing both inacute and long term treatment patient
Yeah
 Fantastic
" Obviously, again, in terms of the NICE guidance, it was it was eagerly anticipated, because the previous update was in 2012, which was prior to any of the DOAC's receiving market authorization"
" So it was been, it was quite easy anticipated"
 And I guess there's probably the biggest change is around the long term treatment recommendation
" But I guess in terms of completeness, obviously, the acute phase of treatment was around the recommendations of either apixaban or rivaroxaban in that acute phase of treatment"
" And then, in the longer term treatment says, and I think one of the changes was in terms of if, if the current treatments not well tolerated, or the clinical situation or person's preferences have changed, consider switching to apixababn, if the current treatment is is a doac other than apixaban"
" So obviously, that was quite a big change in terms of that prophylaxis piece"
" And I don't know what what difference that would make at all, and if they're new to your treatment, any longer term prophylactic protocals"
"Yeah, that's good"
" That's good to hear cuz obviously, the evidence base and the safety profile was something which was highlighted in the NICE review, around apixban and especially in terms of that belief profile in the longer term treatment phase"
yeah that was re flagged as being significantly better with apixaban in that longer term treatment phase
 And that was that was taken from antifiac study And it was really had really clear benefits for patients in terms of the fact that they weren't at an increased risk of having a bleed compared to placebo in that longer term phase
" And, obviously, we know that patients patient, there's a large proportion of patients who are at risk of recurrent VTE with the ESC guidance, which was published in 2019"
 And we've got that new intermediate category of patients
 So potentially more patients that are out there who could benefit from longer term treatment
 So I think the NICE publications probably made it a little bit easier
 A to identify those patients who they are
" And B to gives clinicians like yourself the confidence that actually, if you do need to use treatment in the longer term, NICE is really clear about what that recommendation is, and so i guess"
"Yeah, yeah"
" And that was based upon the efficacy and the safety data from antifiacs study, and so clear, a clear benefit in terms of patients in terms of that risk benefit profile, and your longer term treatment phase"
" So I don't know, I know, you've said that you've passed on the reins to hematology now"
" And I presume that They'll look at, protocals in the longer term"
" And I don't know where where was your protocol up to what what did it recommend after six months the patient, but it's still either or apixaban rivaroxaban"
"Yeah, so the exact NCE words I'm sorry we're not allowed to share any of our slides with you today"
"So the the actual wording is for patients who do not have renal impairment, active cancer, or established triple positive understand the phospholipid syndrome, or extremes of bodyweight, either continue to need treatment with the current anticoagulant, if it is, well tolerated"
" Or If the treatment is not well tolerated, or the clinical situation or person's preferences have changed, consider switching to apixaban than if the current treatment is a DOAC other than apixaban"
" So if the patient's not well tolerated, they're not tolerating the DOAC that they are currently managed on"
" At that point, for a longer term treatment, we would consider switching to apixaban or to doac other than apixaban"
"Yeah ofcourse, I guess it's just been aware that thats been updated because some clinicians haven't had a chance to review that for obvious reasons with the situation that we found ourselves in in the last 6-8 months so"
I think it's been lost in translation
"Yeah, yeah, I guess what, what would what we would hope in terms of when you were reviewing patients, and that acute initial phase of treatment"
" And when we consider all of the data, for apixaban especially in terms of the safety profile, profile, both in major bleeds and clinically relevant knowledgeably, that's the only doac that shows a significant reduction across both of those parameters"
" It does stand out for safety profile, and it will be good to see that patients were started on the picture barn, and then that makes that journey for them a little bit"
 A little bit easier
 In terms of evidence in the safety profile
" And I guess, hopefully, hopefully clinicians like yourself will get a chance to sit down and review it once, once we're out of the current situation"
a big job yes
" Hopefully, we'll get a chance to come back in and do some face to face appointments"
" And no, it is interesting what you say because we do have numbers needed to treat in numbers needed to hold for apixaban and we would need 200 patients would need to be treated for apixaban to cause one episode of major or clinically relevant non major bleeds"
 So it's interesting that you say it's only those patients that you've actually see who do have to deal with the ones that are in the forefront of your mind
 Those who don't
"Yeah, but the numbers needed to treat are quite compelling for apixaban as well, like you don't need to treat 14 patients to prevent one episode of recurrent BTE related deaths, so really quite, quite compelling"
 And I think that's been reflected in the NICE guidance as well so
"So if the patient is the patient that would fall into that unprovoked category, which has been further stratified in ASC guidance, where there's where there's now that low, intermediate and high risk categorization for patients that those patients that would fall in the intermediate and last"
" Yeah, yeah"
 We know that there's a high proportion of patients do have the current through the T's and C's
" So looking at that risk, stratification, and so there is a lot there is a lot to be done"
" Potentially, this year is not the right time to do it"
" And next year, maybe um chapter two, I'm not sure if your next is the next call is it 10:30"
I didnt know if you needed to have a break or not
 So you've got a few of these to do then
 Are you doing any clinical stuff today or any research
Very impressive multitasking
"We have Yes, yes"
 We've got a big company meeting which is actually it was meant to start at 10 o'clock and they've just pushed it back to to 1130 so that I won't miss it
 So it's been really lovely talking to you
 Im going to let you sign off so you can have a quick look at your emails before your next call
" Okay, thanks for being so engaged"
 Good luck
Bye bye
