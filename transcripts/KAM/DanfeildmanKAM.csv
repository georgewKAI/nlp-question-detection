It's nice to Nice to meet you
Button out the way so I can see your face
" So firstly, nice to meet you, I'm Dan"
" I'm one of the hospital reps in Manchester, I've worked for Pfizer for about over 20 years now"
Ridiculous of where the time goes
" And I've been doing lots and lots of products over the years, but mainly in cardiovascular and pain"
"Yeah, so quite varied sort of career within Pfizer doing lots of different roles"
" And obviously, appreciate having this conversation to have a little bit of googling and have a look at sort of your profile looks like you"
" You know, you've done hell of a lot, a hell of a lot"
You don't look like
"Yeah, for a long time"
 Yeah
 20 years
"Well, obviously COVID is sort of made things move faster, I think from a virtual perspective"
" And we could talk all day about COVID, couldn't we and how it's affecting everything"
" And But yeah, I mean, I have my reservations around virtual work, I think it's I think it's good for some it's not, it's not for everybody, and it's good for some people have that option, of being able to offer that discussion at a mutually better time for a clinician, and what are your thoughts around sort of virtual and how things have changed"
"Yeah, I agree"
Correct
"Yeah, what what I find sort of quite interesting is I was having a bit of about 20 meetings since lockdown probably since June because we were sort of non promote"
 We were reactive in June and we could do meetings from June onwards
 And I realized for myself that I the customers and both myself get more out when we're face to face when I'm sort of eyeballing an audience because you get the facial expression
 Are you getting any buying signals
" Is it, is it any head shaking or even that q&a is better"
" You know, so you just said exactly the same as what I would say I can far more bang for buck being stood in front of a roomful of customers being bombarded with questions, I love that, that's what I get paid to do"
" And obviously, you know, I want to be passionate about the product"
" You can be you can do at home to a certain extent, but then the door might open or my wife comes in, or the kids come in"
Absolutely
"Third party endorsement, I'd call that"
"Oh absolutely, they'll never go away, there'll be sort of like, I think it'd be like a bit of an 80/20"
" You know, where it'll be 20% virtual, 80% you'll meetup or whatever is appropriate for that particular customer"
"Well, I'm more more AF, but I am I have obviously knowledge of VTE as well"
"Well, it's more around, you know, obviously, I get the impression that you you're very sort of heart failure driven, feel like you've done a lot of work for heart failure, but totally 30, 30% ish of patients with heart failure"
" But I want to ask you about the fact that we're missing not missing a lot of patients, but it has a less because of less footfall at the moment, for obvious reasons"
 We're not picking up a lot of new AF patients
" So how are we at Pfizer going to or as an industry going to be able to pick these patients up in a COVID world, and given the what's going on at the moment really is my question to you"
"An how far is that, sorry, i was going to say how far away is that particular innovation"
"No, no I interupted you"
"Yeah, no you make some very, very valid points, very valid points"
" I mean, you know, stat, Statins, DOAC's have been around since when 20, 2011"
 So they've been nine years
" And I'll be here the detect protect perfect agenda, they don't teach it it's okay so I'm sure you were"
" You know, we've come a long way"
 But there's a hell of a long way to go
" There's, the numbers are still massive, there was one when patients we detect perspective, we've got lots of patients who have had a CHAD VASC score there are nothing, I will call them ticking time bombs"
" And we've got your out of range Warfarin, which slowly but surely are being moved to DOAC, whichever one, I'm not bothered if I'm honest, as long as you give them something that's suitable"
" And so we're getting there, but it's so slow, but the problem is primary care about so many other things going on, even put the virus, COVID aside, it's AF isn't always, you know, front of mind, is it"
 I think it's got to be pushed by the CCG by the PCN's
" And otherwise, it's just we're not going to get to the bottom of it"
I don't know how much interaction you have with your primary care colleagues or PCG's
" Is that, in your role do you take a backseat with that"
" Obviously, lots going on with"
"Do you sort of have much interaction with your primary care colleagues, or pcnl CCG"
 colleagues
"They came out in March, didn't they"
 They came out in March
"You see, that's where I think virtual to that has its place, potentially, I know you, they're probably not going to have as much of an impact as if they were in a room together"
" But it's making the consultant go out in the middle of winter, when they want to go home and have a glass of wine with their family, and then just nip into the other room for an hour and do a meeting, that for me has lots of value"
Everbody needs to pull together
" You know, obviously, we like, you know, Pfizer, BMS, and all the dark companies, we've done lots of meetings over the last six, seven years"
" I mean, God knows how many meetings, hundreds, thousands"
" And which would have made a difference, eeked a difference after each one"
" But it's got I think, it's got to come from CCGs and PCN', I really do, to get full buy in from them"
" And yes, we help"
" And but it's not the be all and end all they need to be sold on why it's important, whichever disease area that the meeting is in"
" And AF, we've come a long way, in 10 years, but there's still a long way to go"
" But as I said, GP's, they'll just have AF on the agenda, they have everything else"
 Well
Don't buy that
Yeah
So what do you think we should do
" If you were if you were running Pfizer, and you obviously you know, our marketing department, what do you think we should be doing over the next 12/18 months"
" Not just from a to grow the drug, talking about disease area perspective, what would be your sort of USP for us"
"Yeah, yeah"
" I mean, I, I'd like to think we're on with doing some of that"
"Yeah, we've always done lots of work when there's the CV prevent agenda that it's quite high upon primary care's agenda at the moment, which is good"
 But I think they need us as an industry to chivvy the GP's along
"It's such a shame that were perce- some, you know companies in the industry are perceived by that because, you know, I could say, you know, look how many strokes we've reduced, look how many bleeds, you know, and I mean each stroke has you know, cost between 12 and 16,000 pounds, you can multiply that God knows how many times"
" And yes, we're you know we're a multi billion dollar company, yes, we're a business we still have shareholders, we, you know, we have to make money"
" And so it all, just the way it is, if we're able to make money in the process, as well as saving lives, everyone's a winner"
100%
"Yeah, yeah, you're completely right, which is why face to face is pivotal moving forward even beyond that"
Yeah
"Yeah, you make a lot of sense"
 You see we're both on the same wavelength there
 I just wish you were one of my customers
It's funny
 My cousin is a GP in Leeds
"Yeah, you might, you might even know Steve, do you know Steven Feldman"
"But I think, his practice is around more Morley area I think, but he's, he's got fingers in lots of pies, he runs lots of different businesses"
" But anyway, and but yes, I know quite a lot people over there in Yorkshire"
 Yeah
 We've gone over our time
" But I know we didn't get to have, we had lots of good discussion around COVID and what what you say makes absolute sense"
 I'll definitely take lots of it on board and use it from a local perspective in Manchester
" I mean, I picked vendors very well over here like it does in most areas of the UK, to be honest, but we can never afford to rest on our laurels because you've got"
 You've got four good drugs out there
" Let's be honest, they all offer value"
" And it's up to us to sort of give clinicians the reasons why in more patients than not, Apixaban is the right choice"
Yeah well nice nice to meet you
And enjoy your calls this afternoon and stay safe
"Alright, see you Klaus"
 Nice to meet you
 Bye bye
