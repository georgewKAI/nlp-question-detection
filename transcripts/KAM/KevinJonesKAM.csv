"Well, let's let me just say hi,"
I'm very good with the WebEx has just put a box up with this removed
 So yes
" Hi, I hope you can see me now"
Yeah
" So, as Tracy just alluded to you, this is your third conversation"
" No in the background of all, all of the people that you're going to be speaking with, I think they're all have been VTE"
" And quite frankly, I think there's probably quite a part from what you do"
 Am I right in thinking that's correct
In in relevant in how does that relate to what you do
Right
 Okay
" Because Because my, before we spoke, I did a little bit of research around homecare pharmacy and assumed that actually, that's where you're from"
 Isn't that
 Is that still correct
 Yeah
Yeah
" And so at the moment, so were you working from home care, you're looking at NICE TA's, specifically"
" If you've got a guideline update, then such as the most recent one for VTE, and recommendations within that for DOACs How does that from an internal process, become do become part of that discussion"
"So fall into the medical director of pharmacists role, I have no written terms of the budget impact analysis, getting things into the formulary, if I know the contacts better than the Directorate for medicine, that I've engaged with those conditions"
 So it's more of a supportive role for the director of pharmacist
" And then I would be involved in disseminating that policy or guideline update to clinicians in my portfolio, and then also engaging the conditions to see if they want to have any input in terms of their primary care stuff"
Yeah
 Interesting
" And so one of the things from this new guideline, big for the reason that VTE one was was health economic comments that lead to recommendations within it"
" Your, in the pharmacy director, how does that then translate to"
 Do we make a decision
 Are we going to change what we currently do based on these recommendations
"it for in this example, it wasn't necessarily acquisition"
" Or, you know, tariffs price, it was all it was very much focused on outcome"
" So if if, you know, when they looked at the, I guess, the medicines optimization, it was around, is there an advantage of one or the other in terms of reduction in risk and bleed"
" And yes, you know, from your perspective, if you've got patients who are taking treatments, that there are risks complete by the way in which they're aministered, then I guess that becomes a little bit more relevant in terms of what the outcomes are correct"
Yeah
" And Does the guidelines influence when it comes down to preference because I think one of the things that NICE say was that we look to sequentially like a sequential pricing to see whether or not there was any, I guess, not error and calculation but whether or not that would change"
 What happens in terms of recommendation
 And what they said was no clinical data was the clinical data
" This is what we're basing it on, irrespective of, you know, whether there will be a reduction in price or considerations in price difference"
" Again, if you're not looking at properties, and you're looking at value, what does this mean to us in terms of our impact of prescribing One doac over another"
 thats the important bit
Sorry
" So the question is, if you look at so its price, so when you get a guideline, it's not talking about price, but he's talking about outcome"
"then, rather than being one preferred over another, do you have to look at the data that NICE have presented to say, actually, are we working in line with nice, or is there a reason why we're not"
"Yeah, no, I agree"
" And I think that, you know, my conversation is that it's the case is quite illuminating"
" Sometimes when you do get real life, you know, some experience that they've had, you know, added to the discussion"
" Because from your perspective, you work quite closely with the patient, is that or assume you work quite closely with patients"
" Because on so many, you know, that you get feedback from patients about how their medicines are working for them"
"No, no, I appreciate you"
"Yeah, yeah"
" No, and I wasn't expecting that"
" But my understanding, I think it's just that when I looked at some of the role, you know, description, what you do on a day to day basis, from health care, home care, refinishing, it was sometimes actually looking for feedback from patients about, you know, how their medicines are"
 So you are now removed from that what you're saying
" Yeah, completely"
"No, sorry"
 I'm saying that
 From a homecare lead perspective
 Yeah
 From a BTE perspective
 Yeah
 That was a comment around where the patient contact may
Yeah
 And have you started seeing these any introduce new kind of technologies or results or are looking to use new technology resulted in a way in which you can get feedback from patients as well
Right
 Okay
 And I understand that there's some new technology available that allows patients to give almost instant feedback
" Whether it be it's a patient reported outcome measures is that the same thing, you know, if you've got is that there are apps that have been developed, where you can get feedback from patients, you know, you so you speak to them on a daily basis"
" But if you get a quick response from patients about how their medicines are going, is that something that you considered as well, during this period of time or"
Pharma companies seem to be going down one route and want to engage with you in one way
 How was it
" How do you all how would you prefer to be, you know, to engage with pharma"
" Is there, is there something that you think to get from them, you know, from physicians or"
So one of the things that I've noticed differ for me when I've tried to contact health care professionals about meetings that have been on and date
" So it's almost like how would it help you go through, you know, you'll get a lot of requests to join"
" And not necessarily at the time that you want it, you know, it's kind of like, another request that's come through and other requests has come through"
" I mean, how are you then filtering what you want to know from"
" You know, in terms of the expectational access you want"
"Yeah, and I think Pfizer is developing a new way in which you can access those directly from a healthcare perspective or healthcare perspective"
" With that in mind, so I know that, whereas historically, you go, if you want to find information about a Pfizer product, you would be speared to their sort of like it'd be like a Pfizer pro, who as it's turned, but actually, it's an access for all of, you know, the clinical data that's relevant to a particular medicine"
 What they're doing now is building on that to enable people like yourself to access to meeting contents as well
 So rather than wait for somebody to contact you
" It's a case of, is there anything for export that I'm interested in available"
 And it will be a way of sign pushing
 And I think that's how
"Well, that is, to be honest, it's still in development"
"No, well, I think as long as the content on there is approved, that's that, you know, the issue that we have is making sure that we've got content approved"
" And also, if there's anything that it's accessible, it's updated in line with any changes to any, any of the SPC's or so"
 So that would be the only issue
 So you'd have a time lag there for some of that material content
" I think also, if there's any patient material that needs to be accessed as well, again, I would see in the future that you'll be able to access it and forward it in any communication that you'd have with a patient rather than use something physical, which again, at the moment isn't something where or is happening within other pharma companies"
" So yes, I think if there's the service, but you feel as a value is education and how you delivered it, once you become familiar with how the service that we're offering has been set up"
 I have
"Yes, that's okay"
That's okay
" It's okay, I was just sat here and I thought, I thought like I was prying, you know, when somebody is having a conversation and you just sory of"
"No, I couldn't"
"No, I can assure you none of that was recorded at all"
 But
"How have you managed to sort of navigate working from home more I guess, in your role"
 Or is that completely
"Yeah, absolutely"
Yeah
" And it's interesting as well, because some of the challenges that people will face from working from home, are not apparent until you suddenly go right, so you wondering, I'm going to work from home, you're working from home"
" And like you say, it's kind of like, No, I don't drive a car, like don't have a lot or don't have great internet connection"
"Yes, I agree"
" I agree, as well"
" And I think also that perhaps there's less distractions, like you say, you do get the occasional where somebody is coming into a room"
" But you know, you've got some times that's aside"
" And equally, and I personally believe that this, I find it a bit more engaging, you know, it's a cycle, it's a bit more intimate"
" You know, in term of that, and yeah, a little bit, but we're all very comfortable with it all very quickly, as well"
"Yeah, brilliant well that's nice to hear"
 Yeah
" So whilst you're working with your media team like that, have you found it challenging then to work with any external partners that you have or from, you know, whether it be people that are involved in home care delivery, service itself, that you've been working with, or commissioners, where you've had to sit in meetings, and you just feel I'm not being heard"
 Or I'm not getting the opportunity to speak
" Or this is not, you know"
Yeah
"Interestingly, we Pfizer have been really good at acknowledging that the time is spent in front of a screen isn't productive"
" And they've given us access to a wellness app, you know, so headspace and encourage you to pickc up activity away from the desk, that allows you just to re energize yourself or refocus or however you want to phrase it or frame it, you know, so that you can get away in that"
" And I suppose the challenge that you've got is that if you are sat there and you feel that you're, you know, in a meeting, and you do want to have a little bit of a leg stretch, and it's difficult, unless you just sort of say"
"It isn't it, you suddenly become quite adapt to being able to make an excuse for excusing yourself, you know, yeah"
 Yeah
 Yeah
Yeah
" You know, I think what I really enjoyed about the conversation today is the fact that actually, like you say, when you move away from the prescriptive discussion, it's really nice just to have, you know, connect with somebody"
 And this is a really nice way of being able to do as well
" And I think I've enjoyed that, you know, from that"
" So, yeah, thank you for taking the time"
I think I think it will probably look at me and go
 How do you like that
" What do you do with your time when you're not able to connect with you, the person you're speaking with"
 Is there buffering
" You know, how can you look a little bit more engaged"
 Because I'm sure I just looked at multiple
 Need some acting tips or something
"Yeah, I'm conscious of your time"
" And just say so your next call is half past, isn't it"
Thank you too
We didn't reveal it did we
 So the big reveal
" I cover in East Anglia, which is just a below you really isn't it so in that respect from an STP perspective"
" So I'm Cambridgeshire, Peterborough is currently where I work"
"Somebody to work, or"
"Yes, it is"
 It is
" And, and I think some of the ways in which you've described your the ways in which you'd like to work, it would suit you there as well"
 There is a lot autonomy there is and project work as well
" There is a you know, really interesting spin involved in, so"
" Yeah and you've got some really good clinical experts, which is something that you also mentioned"
" So yeah, yeah something to get involved in in the future, Well, listen, maybe in some future, forward to working with you, perhaps"
Cheers
"You too, thank you"
" Bye bye now, bye"
