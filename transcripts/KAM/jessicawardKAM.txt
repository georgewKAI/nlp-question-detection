QUERY
"Okay, well, first of all, please call me John"
" I've been speaking with you, but one of your colleagues Tarik earlier, so I may find myself repeating myself a little bit because his main interest is apixaban as well"
" And I was, I was explaining to him but we are a single practice pcn"
" I am a PCN clinical director, the one for Whitstable"
" I'm also GP director of strategy for the practice, but very much for us the pcn of the practice is one on the same, you know, we have 25 GPS, three medical centers, and we major and have done for a couple of decades now, on integrated health care such that less slightly less than half of our turnover is gms"
" In other words, standard general practice"
" The other half involves providing community integrated health care, the sort of stuff you'd probably have to go to hospital for normally"
" So in terms of apixaban, and we provide a seven day a week, 12 hour a day DVT diagnosis and treatment service, and we use apixaban for that"
 So we're already sort of aligned on that one
" With regard to AF and anticoagulation for AF we are transitioning people from using warfarin to apixaban or NOAX or DOACs generally, but apixaban seems to be the one because we started off using it in our urgent treatment center that we provide"
 And therefore we've already got experience of it
 So that that's okay
 It's a bit of a bit of a shot in the foot
" For general practice, of course, moving people off warfarin, because the whole idea of providing INR clinics, which we do, and as do those general practices, is actually paid paid activity"
" And if you've got it right, you will make a small profit on that"
" And of course, the more people you move to a diet, the less profit you're gonna make"
" But I think the focus has become as did you use your word on capacity now, particularly in this time of COVID"
" Because the concept of getting people into the buildings to do their INR's has become more challenging, because we've had divert our nursing staff on to what we call the red route"
" You know, we like other general practices, we've got the cold routes for people who probably haven't got COVID and the red roof, people probably have got COVID"
 And we've only got a finite number of staff
" So if we move our nurses into the Red Room, they're going to have to leave something behind"
 And one obvious thing to leave behind are the INR clinics
 So switching people onto apixaban has become well something of a necessity in order to release nurse hours
 For the for the hot side red route activity
 You can use whichever term you like
 And even though it's it's it's It's a money loser
 It's something we have to do in order to sustain our staffing levels
It's not it's not a major income stream to us
" As I was saying earlier, more than half of our income stream is from 3g integrated healthcare"
" We, we we provide a range of outpatient diagnostics, we run an urgent treatment center, we have an ultra clean operating theatre where cataract surgery is done"
" So this is not not a big deal for us, although for other practices, you have a much smaller percentage of non GMS income it may seem more relevant"
" So I mean, the world changes, you know, some doors shut other doors open"
 One has to be philosophical
absolutely is
" But I mean, obviously we we don't just go around money we care about the patients"
 And the concept of reducing morbidity and mortality is very dear to our heart
" And so, yeah, that's absolutely important"
Why I came tomedicine in the first place
" So yes,"
"No, it's not really that so we started off with the rivaroxaban because it was the first one around, we switched to apixaban, probably because of liaison with east kent hospitals trust because it became their, their front runner"
" And when they switched, we followed simply because we liaise with them about, well patient care in general"
" But certainly with regard to our DVT pathway, we do the A's is one of the hematologists although we use for advice for the complex cases, only but you know we're very, very well aware of what each other are doing"
 So I suppose it was a bit of an East Kent wide switch from rivaroxaban to apixaban
" And so there may be some people who are left on rivaroxaban and simply because if people are used to something they don't wish to switch you know, it isn't broken, I don't want to fix it"
" Leave me alone, please"
" So there but the minority and all of the new cases certainly tend to be on apixaban, if they're not going to opt for warfarin, because some people actually like the psychological crutch of having warfarin monitoring"
" Which, of course, unnecessary with NOAC's"
"Yeah, it's the switch from a drug warfarin, which requires monitoring, and we use drumming into them, you may get the dose wrong, you might bleed or you might have another stroke"
" And then all of a sudden, here's another drug, which is much more convenient"
 But there's no monitoring
" And that frightens some people, I think, Oh, no, I've needed monitoring, you've drummed into me, I've been on warfarin for Lord knows how long with monitoring and besides which I like seeing the nurse because she's friendly"
" blow me down, you're saying that's right, my life is gone"
 So some people have a real real issue with that
" Having said that, new people are very keen not to have to come in for blood tests and monitoring"
 So it's easier starting someone on a NOAC than it is switching someone from Warframe
"yeah, I mean, we obviously say all of that"
 Yeah
"Yeah, sorry, is that the typical comment back is, but how do you know, the dose is right"
"you know, you know, with with warfarin, you knew, because I had INR and how do you know, now, you know, so"
"But having said that, you know, in this in this time of COVID, people are less willing to come into a medical establishment because they're scared of what they might catch"
 And so the switchovers have been have become more more common this year
Well I think all current disease management has taken a bit of a hit
" Really, because as I was saying earlier, we've had to switch a lot of our team on to the red roots"
" And now we're involved in COVID, virtual wards, and we're just about to switch from winter flu immunizations to COVID vaccinations"
" So there's a lot of stuff going on a lot of staff hours going on, involved in non standard pursuits"
 So it is a bit of an issue
" I mean, we are dealing with more people remotely as GP's and our team than we ever were in the past"
" You know, all consultations start with a video call or an audio call"
 So the opportunity to just literally grab someone's wrist and opportunistically discover AF is much less than it was which which is a shame
 So I haven't seen our fingers for this year
 But I wouldn't mind betting that arm our rate of putting new patients on the AF register has probably gone down this year
" Not just for us, but in England as a whole"
"I mean, we we do opportunistically do this for everyone you meet face to face anyway, we employ two pharmacists as well, they don't actually see patients"
" So now yes, we talked about community pharmacists, you know, High Street chemists, they again are doing a lot, a lot of remote work"
" Now, you know, they stepped up on the delivery side, you know, electronic prescriptions delivered rather than people coming into the shop"
" And a lot of them suffered with that, of course, on the retail side, because the retail shops are not being visited"
 And I gather that quite a few of you have gone bankrupt as a consequence
" So the opportunities are reduced for face to face, not just for us, but also other other allied health professionals as well"
yes
" I mean, this is the The Untold Story of the damage COVID has done, isn't it"
" Because, you know, we know, to some extent, how many people have caught it how many people have died"
 But we certainly don't know about what we've missed
" We are seeing as a system, less stroke patients, now, they must still be happening, that they haven't disappeared"
" So our feeling is probably the people with minor strokes just staying away, that they just don't want to go to anywhere near a doctor because they might now catch COVID"
 They don't go near a hospital for the same reason
" So we have restarted our so called cough clinics, including hypertension, diabetes, a with me a management when we restarted everything just just restarted spirometry, although we're slightly worried about using spirometers"
" So yeah, this will be the the studies that have done for the next few years seeing what what's the toll in other non COVID illnesses"
"I think there's detection is one new step, the way we detect could change"
" I mean, there, there are many apps and indeed these things, you know, I'm wearing a smartwatch"
 Don't tell me if I get sick
" Well, anyway"
" So I think a lot of people will be self diagnosing, you know, there's the one that you can use with mobile phone as well, which is pretty, pretty neat"
" So, you know, those people who are tech savvy, will actually be self diagnosing"
" I think we'll be picking up and we have a low we have 20 or 30, AF devices, you know, the ones you literally Oh, yeah, yeah, in our practice 30 of those, and we're giving those out to people"
" So that ways of protecting which don't involve face to face with a health professional, that will change"
" Pardon me, I think because of the challenges we've already gone through about getting people to into INR clinics with a limited workforce, the switch to NOAC's will will will happen because of constraints on workforce"
"And yeah, I think if we, if we're being honest, there must be a lot of people out there with AF that we don't know about, particularly intimitent AF"
 And I think that is a concern
" And the more we can get people into, you know, self diagnosis, self monitoring, I mean, I think it has been creeping up for all sorts of things such as, you know, blood sugar and blood pressure anyway"
" But I think this is one of the opportunities if you can dare say that with a pandemic, you know, one on one of the good things about the pandemic is that people are now embracing the idea of remote monitoring, remote consultation"
 And I think there's an opportunity to try to get more and more of these devices out there
" And, you know, either the general practices or indeed hospitals to hand them out, or to encourage people to buy them themselves"
"as I was saying earlier, we are a single practice pcn"
 We do have clinical leads in a lot of areas and jokers we used to be called gypsies with an extended roll up called gypsy's GP with special interest but the terms changed
" So, yes"
" And we also by being a single practice PCN we have education meetings, what we did before COVID"
" Anyway, yeah, face to face three, Monday's out of four"
 We don't do that now
 But we have virtual meetings
" So we we always try to attract new GPS, who can be good GPS, of course, but also will bring something extra, whether it be a special interest or an educational role, that that'll get you into our practice, if you're just a good GP and that's it"
" Well, that's not quite enough"
 We're in quite a fortunate position that we've never had vacant spaces
" We've got a waiting list for GPS, which is a bit unusual"
 But it's because of the way we practice general practice and integrated healthcare together that is appealing to GPS is more interesting professional life
" So yes, so we do have leads for anticoagulation we have leads for liaison with the high INR clinic"
" And in terms of our urgent treatment center, our lead ACP, you know, acute care practitioner nurse that has done a master's in thromboembolism and embarrassed to say she knows more about it than I do or any other GP"
" And yeah, absolutely the right person to run our DVT diagnosis and treatment clinic, but, and she also liaises with one of the hematologists, who does an outpatient in one of our buildings, who's very helpful as well"
" So why not, we like to think we're quite well educated"
 And we have good resource within the practice and visiting consultant as well
 So that that's really quite helpful
quite a lot of our colleagues are now moving from full time to one less session full time in order to pursue their interest
 And our model doesn't involve all GP doing the same thing every day
" Our model is about developing a community Integrated Health Care Center, where everybody brings something extra to the table"
 And they're given time to do that
 And a session of doing a clinic is paid the same as a session doing GM's
" And we accept that and respected takes a bit of time getting there because people say, you know, you're going off to play with the train set, and you've been paid the same as me and I'm holding the fort"
 So you have to go through that sort of phase
" But actually, it's extremely good to find that people are stimulated and to have a resource to go to in the practice rather than have to refer someone to outpatients or try to phone up a consultant for a problem that doesn't necessarily need an outpatient department"
" If you've got that resource in the practice, it enriches everyone's life, and we can all bring each other standard up"
it's much more efficient for the patient journey because they don't have to go back and forth to the hospital if you've got a resource you can talk to in the building
" And, you know, the easy cases are easy, but you've got someone with multiple long term conditions, you know, they got renal failure, they might be pregnant, there might be other reasons why it's quite complex"
" So it's actually very helpful to be able to talk to somebody face to face about this, rather than just throw up your hands as a as too difficult if you go to the hematology clinic, which is a shame for the patient"
 And it's a shame for the clinic because it can be dealt with in this different way
"I mean, you're with respect"
 I'm not sure there is anything big because of the setup I've just described
" Yeah, on site hematologist"
" And on site, ACP, who's got a master's in thromboembolism"
 Yes
" I think I think we're, we're, we're in a pretty good place"
" Some other practices who don't work like this, may well need more information from you"
" But yeah, I don't think that's us"
"you know, it has that showing you you're rather preaching to the converted here, because we found it a useful drug or reliable drug"
" And we're using it as is, east kent hospitals"
" So, you know, it's not as if a patient comes out, you have to switch them from one drug to another, or if they go into hospital, as long as the hospitals switch them to one drug to another, that there's a consistency, which is which is helpful"
"I'm sorry that will be a question for one of our pharmacists, on"
 I don't know that no
"yes, I mean, Pfizer have supported some of our educational meetings by bringing a consultant in, and quite often that that will not just be a lecture, it'll be a question and answer session about cases, you know, in a case discussion, or someone who, you know, doesn't fit the bill of being a fit patient that you can put a stamp on a standard dose"
 So it's actually very helpful and that sort of support as been useful to us
Okay
"it's a good model, and it has the added advantage that you can attract GPS and other health care professionals into it because they want to work in it"
 So it has taken us a couple of decades to deliver to the extent we have
 So you're not gonna do it overnight
" But, you know, to try and add a couple of new services every year and keep going"
 It's a lovely way of working
All right
" Well, nice speaking to Jessica"
bye
