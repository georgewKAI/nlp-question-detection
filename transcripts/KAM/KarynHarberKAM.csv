 Hi there
 I just need to press a button
 I think here
 Are you alright
"Oh have they realIy,"
We like to talk a lot in Pfizer clearly
" Are you alright with that, then if it goes out"
"Oh, that's fine"
" I think it's more for it's the software, isn't it"
 And that that we're looking at
 So hopefully we can get something out of the conversation as well
 That's always the best use of our time
" So yes, Tracy said I work just a little bit southview really"
 But I do work with some of my colleagues actually work up towards tea side way
 So are you Newcastle or do you go down a little bit from there
Yeah
 Yeah
 They probably get up as far as T side
 I don't think they get not quite as far as far as us no
 I'm not I'm not great in my geography up there
" I have to say, although I do pass through occasionally"
" So um, and just get make sure I've got this 100%"
 Right
 You're a clinical pharmacist
" Yeah, and pcn lead or not"
 I don't know
 So practo
That's what's written on our brief that's why
"Well that's good you might be able to answer a couple of the questions that are more PCN based, but happy to talk about anything, you know, to do with your role, really"
"So um, I suppose what the first question to ask because I know all all the clinical pharmacists have slightly different roles in our area"
" Yeah, not all of them are patient facing not all of them are prescribing and they all seem to do slightly different things"
" So from your point of view, what's your actual"
"So you're bringing up capacity so they can do, yeah, a bit more of that kind of thing"
 Are you prescriber yourself
Separate and standalone
"Sorry, sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt you"
Yeah
" Okay, I've just done you've touched on safety a couple of times there"
 That's that's a big part of your role
" Clearly, have you got any sort of tools that you specifically use to help you with that, I know, pincer, is quite Yeah, to be using"
You know their are ties behind it
Yeah
" So for your DOACs how how do you manage those as a practice, then"
 And has COVID had an impact on the way that you've been managing those patients
"So I know, a lot of the practices of what they've obviously had to go more virtual"
 Yeah
" So it's, I think that I don't know, in your area, specifically, but there's been a big move in a lot of areas to move as many patients away from Warfarin towards DOACs"
" So that the touch points, the less that kind of thing"
Just incase
Your a bit more relaxed about it
Yeah
"Because they're all different as well, aren't they"
" In how they Yeah, yeah, a lot of them want to be face to face"
 Or are they good with the digital things
 Are they able to use websites
 Yeah
Yeah
 Erm and we've got a lot of digital poverty
" So yeah, you know, it is more difficult for things like that"
" And then touching on the monitoring again, you know, for a very long time, we weren't bringing people in, you do to do things unless we absolutely have to"
 And you have to sort of do a bit of a risk benefit
" Erm decision on how you know, this person's due their six months U's and E's"
 How urgent is it for me to actually do it this month
" Or Yeah, kind of wait, have has their CKD been stable for sort of a couple of years"
"So the chances are things are okay, or is it on a decline"
 And they're on that border for a dose change
 Yeah
" You know, different bits and pieces like that"
" The number of patients who don't have scales at home, is there is something I've definitely learned,"
I would never even think of that no
That is really interesting
 I would never have thought to ask it in that way
Absolutely
 Yeah
Yeah
" Well, yeah, nothing's perfect"
 That is a really good tip that actually I really like that
Mm hmm
Yeah
 And just in a different way
 Yeah
 Because it is different
" You know, do you do you do this kind of thing with your patients then"
 Or does it tend to be a phone call
 Or do
That would be really useful
"Oh, hi, again"
" I think it was just buffering and you froze, and then you just disappeared"
Yeah it must of been a signal thing Tracey will probably respond to me now
 I'm just texting her to see what I should do
"I can see you yeah, yeah, you're in twice"
 I think you're dialed in on the one that disconnected and then you're dialed in
" Oh, she's just I'll just quick to text her back now and just let you know that let her know that you're back on"
" But yeah, I think you just dialed in twice"
 So that would be why one of them's not got video and one of them has that that's what it is
 I think
I don't think it matters
 I've done this before
" Sometimes we dial in on two devices, if we're going to show slides on one device, and we want to see people's faces on the other one you'd be dialed in twice"
" Fair, it never seems to matter"
 So so hurray
" But erm there was only one of the question that I was just gonna ask you about your, uh, your SMRs"
 Yeah
 So I'm presuming a lot of your sort of warfarin or DOAC patients are going to fall into that category
" Because typically on their polypharmacy, whatnot, won't they so do you sort of proactively search for those patients through sort of audits or how do, you know how to find them"
We have Ardennes quite a lot down here I think
Yeah
 Yeah
" No, that makes sense and while there, and when you're pulling patients in for various reviews that do you do sort of do take the opportunity to do detection as well"
"A dodgy one yeah,"
It's gone walkabout
Right
 Yeah
 The official project
"No, absolutely"
 It's not the best time for that
"Thank you, we are gonna have to finish on it"
" Because we're a half an hour, there's so many questions I can ask you and it's been really interesting, you just you don't get time to chat, you know, to people such as yourself and really, because we're so focused on the brand, usually, and you know, you got to feedback into the conversation and it's really interesting, just understanding a bit more about what you do in your role and how you sort of, you know, work within the practice"
There's got to be a mutual benefit
"But no, it's been really interesting from my point of view, and just really odd, because obviously, I'm not saying the things I'd normally say and yeah, trying to sort of show you the things that we have that can support you"
" But no, it's been great"
 Thank you ever so much
"Yeah, that is it for you today, then"
"Well, I hope you have a lovely Christmas"
" Yeah, take care"
 Bye
 Cheers
