"Oh hi, so hi Samantha"
 It's nice to see you in this
"So so I'm Sarah Cocking and and I'm a network and sales specialist down in in Bristol so so I work Bristol, North Somerset, South Gloucestershire"
 So it's really nice to be talking with you today
" And so I just wondered if we, you know, kind of the objectives of this call if I could understand a bit more about your role, and kind of your where that fits in with and, and priorities, because it would be really love lovely to kind of see if there's any agendas that we can work on together"
" And, you know, looking forward already support that we can give you from Pfizer"
 So does that sound okay
"So yeah, it'd be lovely to know a bit more about your sort of pharmacy background, and then what you're doing now and your priorities, that sort of thing"
"Interestingly, down in Bristol they have practice based pharmacists for a long, long time, like way before a lot of other bits of the country"
" And, and so a lot of those pharmacists there have taken over chronic disease management, they do a lot of medicines optimization, a lot of prescribing pharmacists as well"
 So we and we've got quite a lot of pharmacists here that I speak with that are partners as well
" So I kind of understand a bit about that, but obviously, that that doesn't pertain to what you personally do"
" And but obviously, with the roles of the PCN's as well, the fact that pharmacists are such a key part of that is, well, it's just fantastic for your profession reallyy, I think in the opportunities that that gives people"
 So it's kind of where so that's a little bit about what I know
Yeah
"Ah, okay"
 Yeah
And so so is it quite a symbiotic relationship then between you and the PCN pharmacists
 It's very very- you work as
Yeah
" Yeah, of course"
"Because is your is your practice big enough to be a standalone PCN then, or has it got"
Okay
 Okay
 So they also go around the other practices obviously
"Oh, right"
 Okay
Yes
 Okay
 Yeah
" Because, yes, down here, some of ours are"
"Yeah, yeah"
" So that's quite a shift for you though as well, isn't it"
" Suddenly having it, you know, it's work works well has it having"
"I was thinking that's quite a lot, quite quite"
"I bet it's a bit of a wake up call sometimes, isn't it to people that aren't, you know"
"It is, yeah, because I think they, I don't think they quite realized exactly how much I was involved in or just quite how much people call on me to do something, which isn't maybe naturally a pharmacist job"
" But because of my, maybe my nature or the way I work, it's just something that yeah, that falls into, and probably I'm guilty, as well as going of just not saying no to anything"
" Or going yeah, oh, you could do this"
 It's really simple
 I'll just quickly do it
" And then before you know where you are, you've got"
you're the lead on it
"Yeah, having sold respiratory drugs and you know, try I can imagine"
" Yeah, it's never quite the same is it"
"No, no absolutely"
Absolutely
Yeah
"Of them sequentially, yeah"
"Yeah, of course"
that's a lot of time
"Yeah, yeah"
" You know, because, I mean, I'm aware that we're kind of running out of time, but you know, I think I think it is it's taken the best of what has worked over the last year, isn't it and carrying on with it"
" So, you know, for us, I think, you know, virtual virtual calls, it is a massive thing, you know, our temperatures have just been made a lot bigger, and you are like, I mean, I cannot wait to get back out and see customers, but I think it will definitely change"
 It I think people have got used to that kind of digital interaction either it be over the phone or virtually
" And, and I think also, you know, we do a lot of education, especially with with practice based pharmacists"
" And the fact that they're not having to go out at night actually is a real bonus that they can do it from, from their spare room or their lounge or whatever"
" And I you know, I just think that will, you know, really have a big impact"
" And I think all meetings we do, even if they're imperson, will always going to have that digital element"
"Yeah, I find ironing really helps me, it helps me concentrate, actually"
 But that's really interesting
"So I'll take that out the ways to learn because I think, you know, I know a lot of a lot of the pharmacists that I know really well, and, you know, even some of those are fed back in, and they're getting bombarded with invites from industry"
" And I think that's a really good thing for me to take away is that if we can put more information maybe about what kind of level it's pitched, it's really usefull"
"Because whether it is yeah, you know, for for people just setting out like your eight week and PCN pharmacist or yourself, who's got years of experience, but that could be a really good thing for us to make clear, actually who"
"Oh well listen, Samantha it's been so lovely talking to you today"
" I'm just kind of really aware of the time but thank you all that, you know, it's um, it's really it's lovely to hear about what you're doing and the bits that are very similar to round here and all, but I think certainly for me taking away that that invite thing to make it clear, as you know, is really valuable"
 So okay
 Thanks ever so much
