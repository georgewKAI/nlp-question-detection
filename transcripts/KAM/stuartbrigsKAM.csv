"Hi, Klaus, how you doing, you well"
Yeah
" Well you know, I'll give you a quick introduction to myself"
" So, yeah, my name is Stuart Briggs"
" So I've worked for Pfizer for Gosh, 24 years now"
Thank you very much
 I do appreciate that
"Yeah, well, no, I I worked for the sun Alliance for a couple of years before I went into the pharma industry has I've got a life science degree behind that"
" And then I've, since then, I've been I've worked from Pfizer"
 I launched Atorvastatin starting back in 1997
I was parke Davis
Yeah
" So I was originally Parke Davis, as was my colleague, Dan Feldman, who I think you may have spoken to earlier today"
 I went through that
" And then in terms of cardiology, now I'm involved with the nonvalvular, atrial fibrillation side of things with apixaban"
 But I'm also doing some work with vyndaqel
 But its generic name is Tafamidids for cardiomyopathy
 Right
" So I, I'm not sure if you're aware of that at all"
Yep
" Because I appreciate you within you work within the cardiology field, and you've got interest within heart failure as well, your self havent you"
"Medicine moves on so quickly, it doesn't turn markable"
" Because they said did you know  one of my colleagues bill barrack, who used to work around the Leeds area for Parke Davis"
its changed times
It is it is a challenge
 It is
" It is certainly one of those things we've, I expect we've had to build on it over the last few months, I expect certainly through the COVID times"
 And a big part of it is actually getting the technology right as well
 Yeah making sure that our platforms work with your platforms
" And I know in the NHS, now you're going down and Microsoft Teams routes"
" And at least we can communicate and we can actually speak to you and see you and when we share our screens and share details with you, you can actually see those as well"
 So
"I think it is a tool, isn't it"
" And it's, you know, it's very handy to have when we're unable to be in front of you and so on"
 And you'd like to say my career has changed drastically from those Atorvastatin starting days
 I did ACE inhibitors
 So back in heart failures
" Also I did the Parke Davis, ACE inhibitor in those days was aquapro"
 quinapril
"And then obviously, coming along"
 I've done a Eplerenone mineralocorticoid receptor blockade
" And then like I say, Now, I'm more coming back into heart failure with tafamadis"
 But that's for the transporting cardio stuff
 The amyloid cardiomyopathy
 I don't know if you've been involved with the amyloid cardiomyopathy stuff much
"Yes, yes"
 Yeah
" I, you know, I think I'd say, you know, your interests, obviously are lying in other areas"
" And I think it's, like you say it's a rare disease"
 And that's difficult
 Yeah
 And rare diseases take a different path
" They take a different path, that path and I just said this, the centrally commissioned nice makes a recommendation on it"
 And I expect I hope like most areas in every area of medicine we work in is to make sure Difference those patients lives
 Can you extend life in a meaningful way
 Yeah
 Which gives quality of life
 And that's kind of another area that we're working in
" And it's nice, it complements some of our discussions that we're having within the cardiology fields, it adds interest in today's physicians who have got those interests there as well"
"Yeah, yeah, very much"
" So I'd like to say it's, it's getting the relationships, as well as building relationships over the internet we used to"
" And again, I expect with apixaban"
" It's building relationships with the whole team, not just the consultants, it's the registrar's it's the is the nurse consultants, it's the junior doctors"
" And it's how it all fits together and coming to see you in your office is one thing, but he says we walk out to your office as well, and we bump into somebody else that you would Yeah, he says to another, if that doesn't happen quite as much"
Right
" And I say that COVID has given its own limitations to what you can do as well in the in the hospital, assuming you must have some real impact with your, with your patient interactions surely"
A few links with our company
"It's, you know, it's, like you say, it's exciting times,"
"I love working for Pfizer, and it is one of the things that we see is that is a company that has success, and continues to have success and drives patient outcomes and well being for patients"
" And that's a nice part to you know, to be involved with"
 It's fantastic
 I do believe as well at times just about run out
" No, we were told it was about a 15 minute discussion and yes, tight time really does fly by"
"I'm in the middle of it living Grantham, say in Lincolnshire in Grantham"
because it's about an hour down the coastline from Leeds isn't
"Oh, yeah, I would have driven probably, I don't know"
 Considerable miles each day
" I expect because I work and live in Lincolnshire, and I expect up to the county hospital in Lincoln will be about an 80 mile return trip"
" But yeah, it varies"
" And certainly if we're traveling out to into darbyshire into the peaks got to royal, the Royal Hospital in Chesterfield"
 Yeah
 I don't think our territories are quite as large as they used to be back in the Parke Davis days
So we do seem to now have smaller territories less time actually on the road and more opportunity to be in the hospital in front of our customers in normal times obviously
 So we look forward to coming back and do a bit more of that
Yeah
 I haven't got an awful lot more other than my general day job at the moment
" This, not for this project"
" But yes, we keep ourselves busy"
 All right
 Thank you very much
 It's been a great time having a chat and we'll connect again
" Yeah, I'm sure we will sometime"
 Thanks a lot again
