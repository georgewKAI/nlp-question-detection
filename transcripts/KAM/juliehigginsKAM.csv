Discuss then Hillary
 Hi
" Well, I'm Julie I work in Staffordshire, Shropshire and I've been dealing with anticoagulation for a long, long time now"
 I used to be at Behringer
 And so I'm not quite sure what your actual position is whether anticoagulation is relevant to you
 I'm sure it is because I think most of the calls you've had will have been about anticoagulation
"Yeah, right"
" It's quite interesting that because I just deal with VTE, so just DVT's and PE's"
" And there's a practice, a group of practices not far from me, in Telford held up, I'm sure I'm not speaking out of turn there"
 I know that would be okay to tell you that
" And they have a similar sort of number of practices to you, there's 11 of them"
" It's a much more condensed area, though, geographically, it's tough"
" It's not a massive place, but quite highly populated"
 And then looking at the moment to take the VT service out of secondary care and move it into primary care
" And as you were talking, I was thinking of maybe that's something that you'd either looked at, or would be interested in"
" But when you've got one practice that covers 600 square miles, I don't know how you would actually that was, I thought I thought it was on equipment"
" And I don't know how that would actually work trying to get people in to get them scanned, and to do D-dimers, or anything like that"
What happens at the moment with your VT service then do you refer everybody straight into hospital
 Or are they treated in practices
"No, no, of course, of course, you're gonna get quite diverse"
 So what is the trust in your area
" Do they, Do you have a contract with them to take your patients"
"So it's really difficult and difficult to form a cohesive policy from a pcn point of view, isn't it"
 Yeah
 different systems
" And I mean, I suppose the things to point out really, is the new NICE guidelines for VT have, were released, actually, in March"
" And they were obviously, there was, there's been a lot of things going on since March"
" And the understatement of the year, isn't it, but there's been a lot of things going on since March"
" So it may have been something that's come in, sory of under the carpet and nobody under the radar rather, and nobody is aware of it"
 But they're quite specific around the treatment of DVT
" And PE, but then they do talk about the long term guidance, and the importance of treating patients against having a recurrent VTE"
" And, and then the ESC guidance goes a little bit further in that we've always looked at unprovoked and provoked DVT's and PE's"
 And that's been the sort of demarcation line
" If somebody had had an unprovoked DVT, or PE they would be treated for longer"
" Well,"
 It's the European Society of Cardiology
"Previously, an unprovoked has always been something that has caused a DVT or PE, within a person that didn't have a provoking factor, so provoking factors were thought to be"
 Cancer is always a provoking factor
" And because there's a lot of patients who have cancer who have DBT's and PE's, which we're not licensed or not, none of the DOAC's are licensed for that"
" And then there's although there are ongoing trials for everybody, major surgery sort of hips, knees, anybody who's immobile for any length of time, people who are bedridden those sorts of factors that you would think Well, yeah, we know, pregnancy is on, obviously not licensed for pregnancy"
" And it's anticoagulation, contraception is the word I'm looking for"
 contraception was worn
" And then unprovoked, was everything else"
" And right, but or previous, anybody who's had a previous one if they have another one, and that's considered to be an unprovoked provoking factor"
 But now the ESC have bought in an intermediate group
" So that's a group that sits in the middle of because it was a little bit black and white, on provoked and provoked, so they bought in this intermediate group"
" And that's anybody who you would think, well, that's not a provoking factor sort of surgery, they're left with less than 30 minutes, or somebody who's had a flight to long haul flight or somebody who's long car journey, that sort of thing"
" There's somebody who'd had a long flight, the thinking is that there is something inherent in them something idiosyncratic that it they are predisposed towards having an event"
" And so if they were to have a long cycle from Northumbria down to Cornwall, and they have a clock, then that wouldn't have been considered before as a provoking factor"
 But now it comes under the ESC and it's probably worth having a good look at
 It's quite a simple table in the ESC guidelines
 And it does define exactly what they are talking about
 But those patients are almost as likely to go on and have another event
 There
" It's sort of split 50 50 almost at the moment that you know if you have this if you're in this intermediate category, and you have a VT or DVT DVT or PE you are as likely to go on and have another event as somebody who's had an unprovoked or if something within you that is causing you to have an event"
" Rather than a factor, a provoking factor, like surgery, or big surgery, or, you know, being immobile, that sort of thing"
" So it's, they do recommend that these patients are treated for longer"
" So looking out, because obviously, the the side effects of actually having recurrent DVT's are quite nasty with post thrombotic syndrome"
" And so it is worth looking at that group of patients as well as as a as an organization such as your own it is worth having a look at those because obviously, they're going to cause unplanned admissions"
 And they're also going to long term they could have some other health issues
 So just worth having a look at the new NICE guidelines
MG158
 Yes
 And they let me just check I'm sure it's MG158
" And also, the ESD 2019"
 guidelines
" Just I've just put them in glasses, Hillary 158 MG158"
" Yeah, yeah"
 But they do
" I mean, I know we're not I mean, they do list this transient, intermediate risk as minor surgery, admission to hospital for less than three days"
 So that would normally have not been a provoking factor
" Estrogen, as we said, estrogen therapy contraception, pregnancy, confined to bed, and a leg injury without a fracture, though, you know, long haul flights, and then that kind of the malignant stuff"
" But that that provoked factor, but it's worth it is worth having a look at these, and making people aware of them, I would say as well within your organization, just so that you know that this new guideline has come out and it's it's quite prominent, the risk factors quite prominent"
"Yeah, it's it, I suppose everything's finite, isn't it, you've only got a finite number of resources"
" So you know, the most immediate threat with COVID"
 But in the long term complications of recurrent BPE are quite nasty
" There's the pulmonary hypertension as well, which is very difficult to deal with, difficult to control"
" So if somebody is coming back repeatedly, they and I said post thrombotic syndrome is very unpleasant as well"
" So it's worth having a look at when there's a bit of breathing space, it's worth having a look at these new guidelines just to to familiarize everybody with them"
"Right  It's on a set, but I have got it, it's on a different slide"
" Find it in the timeline, and just just bear with me one second"
" Just bear with me, no problem"
" And you know what, I haven't got that"
" I haven't got the difference between those two groups, but it will be in the I've only got an abridged version of the ESC guidelines here"
 Because obviously they will be quite Let me see if they've got a code number though that you could have
"now, it just says ESC"
2019
 It doesn't really give a number for that
 There's no it's not like MG158 for nice
 ESC 2019
"But the author, voice Konstant, Konstantidis"
 So that's K O N Yeah
 T for Tommy
 Yeah
 N for Nancy
 T I N for nancy again
 I D E S Okay
 Yeah
" 2020, but the ESC guidelines in 2019"
 So I'm not 100% on that
" Let me, no , it's not it's not going to get that"
" But if you looked up ESC 2019 DTE guidelines, then I think it would be in there"
" And the intermediate risk of VTE recurrence which is the, probably the one"
 Yeah
 Heading or not
 I don't know
 look into that
" Yeah, no, I don't have that I'm afraid but it doesn't give the um to the it does say that transients or reversible factors give a greater than or equal to 10 fold increased risk prefers to BTE but I'm not sure whether that will actually answer your question"
yeah
 And the thing is that our local people have got all this they've got
 We use it down here
 And it's called a budget impact model
" And it will tell you the numbers involved over your geography can actually extrapolate how many people you have, or how many patients you have in your area, and then the likelihood of DVT and PE's amongst them"
 So our local people will be able to do that for you
"Well, what they're looking to do now is to take and they're going to do it as well, they're hoping to, they were looking to do it as as a practice, they were going to buy the equipment, and have one of their practices as a hub, which obviously, as I said, it's quite a densely populated small area, there are 11 or 12 practices, but they can get paid easily between them"
 And and then they were going to treat themselves without going into secondary care
" Obviously PE's are different, they will go into secondary care, and usually more complicated, but the DVT's will stay within primary care"
 And now the CCG two CCGs have merged so that Shropshire and Telford have both merged
 And they're looking to do it as a whole county because Telford isn't exactly so they look into doing county wide now the two CCGs have merged
" And I don't know whether that's on a I don't think it will save them an awful lot of money if I'm honest, because they the patient numbers aren't huge"
 But what it might do is form a cohesive kind of guideline that they can all follow
" Because it obviously Shropshire is very rural, and quite affluent"
 Telford is quite densely populated and quite deprived in parts
" So if two completely different areas merge, so I don't think you'll actually save that much money, but I think it might give everybody a standard of care that is more uniform than it has been in the past"
Yeah
 And I think it's because this one PCM had actually looked at it
 They're involving them in the whole discussions now so they'll do with their help but how that worked out in Shropshire
" I'm not quite sure because like you, Shropshire is a big county and it's rural"
" So I don't know how they'll actually make that work, but they are trying to do it"
"Yeah, that's difficult"
" And if you were talking with Shropshire, if you were talking about Shrewsbury, which is obviously a quite a well known town, that, again, is quite dense, quite affluent, but densely populated, but the more rural areas, it's a massive county geographically, it's a big County"
" So how they would do that across them all, I'm not sure"
 But they made that a lot of small stuff
" I use the term cottage hospital, they're not called that anymore, are they"
" But they're still in use for various things, whether they perhaps localize them into there, I'm not quite sure, but it's something they're looking to do"
That's interesting
" Yeah, I think it's one of those"
" If you've got people who've got a special interest in it, I think we've came about because somebody in the original PCN is very interested in it"
yeah
" Yeah, that thing that power that"
 That's how he thought
" That's the spark, isn't it when you get somebody who wants to do something, and he's trying to change things at the moment, so that's good"
" Good patients I think,"
"Yeah, yeah"
 Yeah
" So yes, that's the only thing I can actually suggest you have a quick look at the NICE and ESC"
 Yeah
" Yeah, well, especially better draw this to a close havent we, We've run over a bit but nice to speak to you and yeah"
 Okay
