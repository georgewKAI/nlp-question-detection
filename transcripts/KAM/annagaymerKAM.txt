QUERY
Good morning
 So you're in for a day of excitement with Pfizer then today
You got these plans for the whole throughout the whole day
"Oh, that's not too bad"
 At least you can have a little grip
" By the end, you may need a slight drink by the end of it"
" I have to say, but it's really good of you to join us today and take part in this"
 I think it's is new for us as it is for you
 So and I think it'll be interesting to see what they come back with
 So we're not allowed to show any content
 And my understanding is your pharmacist within secondary care
 Correct
 Excellent
" Okay, so we can talk about anything realistically, but we should probably veer towards something to do with work"
" So I'm sort of wondering how you're getting on with your ICS planning, and how that's looking for you and what sort of shape that's taking because I cover surrey and Sussex, and east Berkshire area"
 And there are the various varying stages across the whole area
" So it's quite interesting just to get a feel, because I think everybody's doing it slightly differently"
" So in interesting way, just so that we can at least have some experience, because it's all quite new"
"Okay, well, that's, that's quite interesting, because I am finding, across other areas that despite everything that's happening at the moment with them, with the craziness of it, in the NHS, things are starting to move along"
" And I think maybe it's because some of the higher level guys are freed up slightly, and it's more the clinicians that are at the coalface, as such, so it's given them a little bit of time to concentrate on some of the things that are becoming quite important"
" But and interesting, as you say, until there is one pot of money, it's never going to be a completely unified service"
" But and so just in terms, then is how do you think that's going to make your job change within within that sort of structure,"
And I think you're not the only one that's going to feel that and that almost that lack of autonomy so that you can't actually make those decisions
 And do you feel that that could probably bring about better communication so that everybody really is on the same page
" Or do you think it's going to end up being told you this is what you're going to do, because it's going to happen across the whole trust, and this whole ICS"
" And you've got to do anyway, whether you whether you agree with it, or you don't agree with it"
"Do you see that causing a problem because in my head, that's starting to raise a few little flags"
"No, I fully appreciate that"
" So I have to be honest, that aside, I hadn't really thought of too much"
" And I suppose in my mind, I had a very optimistic view that literally everybody would be involved in the decisions that come through and hopefully that they'd have a almost an overarching communication channel"
 Wherever everybody could feeding tube
" I suppose that's quite unrealistic,"
So do you think they'll come from within your organization
 or do you think there going to be external
"Okay, that makes me think it's not, yes, there'll be changes, but it would just be somebody else working from a slightly different remit"
" Yeah, they"
"Oh, okay"
 Interesting
" So do you think that's gonna have a big impact on your formulary decisions, then"
Do you think then they'll be led more by cost than they will buy by evidence
" Do you think cost is going to be a bigger play a bigger part in it plays a big part,"
No and that that's it
 So that's gonna make it will make my job
" Quite different, I think because we we are, when we talk to clinicians, we talk clinically, we don't talk about costings at all"
 So I do think that that's going to make it very different conversation that we have to start having with them
" And I think that's probably something that our industry needs to address, as well, because they get really separated roles out that somebody else will deal with cost, so that it doesn't blur any of the clinical efficacy side of things"
 And so I think that's quite an interesting take on how it's going to be
" And it'll be interesting to see how we deal with it as an industry, because I do we move faster"
 I'm not necessarily sure we do move any faster to change how and how we work in that
 But we are looking to realign ourselves more with the NHS
 So I think this is going to be sort of quite interesting times
" And it'll be interesting with, I think, from our side of things that some of the autonomy will be taken away from the CCG as such, and it should theoretically make it slightly more equal"
" I don't know whether I'm, you know, unrealistic in that"
"No, So are they going to involve many clinical people onto the ICS or deciding committee for want of a better word"
"Do you think then that you're going to lose individuality, as it from a trust then"
" Do you think it's going to become a national, almost a national one size fits all"
"Okay, okay, well, I suppose demographically, the there will be changes across the UK, so it can't all match up"
" But, you know, from what you what you how you've described it, to me there It does sound to me as though ultimately, somewhere buried in the ether of it all is we want a one size fits all across the whole of the NHS, and I'm just, I can't I can't see how they're going to make that work"
" But I think maybe somewhere in the subtext, somebody's written that and say, I may be, I may be slightly more cynical than you are in that respect"
Yes
 And we even have that here
 So I'm at the other end of the country to you
 So I'm in the south
 And
"we'd like to say that, but I'm not sure that those here would agree with you"
" And, and I do appreciate we, we have different pressures, and we have a much older demographic, potentially than you guys do"
" And, you know, so our, our services are aimed at that end of it"
" And I'm not, you know, I can't get into this more money here or there"
" Hey, who knows at the moment"
" So just in terms of that, then just swinging it around slightly differently now"
" And just because I'm slightly, I'd say curious, but I think the real words nosey so and you guys then have been really quite badly impacted by the COVID situation at the moment"
" So is that really having a really big sort of massive knock on effect across your whole area, then"
Are you in tier 3 where you are
Okay
" So we are we now teir two, for pretty much most of the area that I cover, and discussions I've been having are almost the first wave, kind of like, hit everybody"
" And we're just like, Whoa, you dealt with it, I sort of on the on the run"
 And people have said they feel slightly better prepared the second time round
" But again, I think the pressures that we have at this end of the world are slightly different from the pressures you have, because you are a higher tier than we are and and therefore you've got more cases"
" I think we've had lots of issues with our care homes in this area, because there's because of the demographics of the population, but it's an interesting one, to see what what stories we get come through after this way"
" And to certain extent, we are leaving a charmed existence compared to some of you guys"
" But that said, I think we're more so slightly shielded from it"
 We don't really understand the whole the whole situation of it
And I do think this is going to have much more far reaching long lasting legacy than any of us ever actually realized at the beginning
" And but not only through the health service, but through all sorts of aspects of society, you know, I think our education system, and it's going to implode"
" And so we can only hope that there are lights at the end of the tunnel with this, whether there is or not jury's out at the moment, let's wait and see in another few months"
" But you know, it's one of those things, isn't it"
 You kind of you have no control over this
 We just have to deal with it as best as we can
"And I think that's something we all need to take on board not just only within your service, but it's something I could probably do more of, and suddenly all of us could do more or"
"Okay, so I'm now very mindful of time, I could stay here and talk to you for quite a long time on this because I think it's really interesting, especially to see the regional differences, but I'm fully aware that you may need to have a battery recharge in between"
 So and what I can only say to you is thank you so much for today
 It actually has been really enlightening and it does give me things to think about so and I will leave you to carry on and and i hope conversations at least have a slight change to them as you go through the day
"Okay, thank you so much for your time, and I'll sign off now"
 Just have a good Christmas New Year and keep yourself safe
