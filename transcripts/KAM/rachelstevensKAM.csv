Are you happy being called John
Ah super
" So this is your third one of today, isn't it"
 How's it going
"It really, it kind of is because I guess with you, in your role as well, as you're doing a lot more stuff digitally on the phone, more training via this kind of route, how are you finding it all"
"I think that's the thing, isn't it"
" I think because initially, to be honest, any reps that you speak to will probably all say exactly the same thing, because we're all so used to seeing people in the flesh"
 Yeah
" And which, you know, between you, me, and the gatepost To be honest, is my preference usually, yeah"
" But I guess at the moment, we've kind of just got to find new and different ways of doing things, haven't we"
" And I, I'm the same, I'll hold my hand up and say, oh I'm not a technophobe"
 But every now and then I get a little bit scared about what might happen
 So you definitely wouldn't be alone on that at all whatsoever
" How have you been finding this morning, though"
 Is it been been quite interesting
"yeah, absolutely"
" I think that's the thing as well is that we, we quite often think about reinventing the wheel"
" But quite often, we don't have to, we just maybe have to embrace things a little bit more dont we"
absolutely
" So I guess really, the thing for me is just to kind of fill you in on what I do is the same as everybody else that you've spoken to this morning"
 So I work within primary care
" So promoting to GP's, like yourself and practice nurses"
" And I currently work around Surrey and Sussex, but I may actually be working in Kent next year"
 Because we've just had a little bit of a restructure
" So you may see me in the flesh at some point in the future, but we'll see how that goes"
" And in which case, it'd be lovely to see in the flesh"
" And but yeah, so I and I've been doing that for quite a while"
" And so it's just kind of really nice to just, I think it's been quite difficult for us this year, as well, because we're not speaking to as many people"
" Sure, it's really nice to speak to real live people and you know, have a conversation with people that we might not know so well, and do something a little bit differently, really"
 And so that's kind of a I've been working from home with a four year old for most of this year
 So that's been interesting
" So that's been the challenge, really, so"
 But he's now just started school
" So that's, that's quite nice, gives me a little bit of a break"
"So I really kind of, I suppose our brief you've probably been, it's been explained to our brief isn't to really sell you the drugs promote the drugs, it's really just to kind of have a chat, see how this technology works and that kind of thing"
" So, but I guess just to I've done a little bit of research"
 So I probably have a little bit of an advantage there because there's probably a lot more about you on the internet than there is about me
 And it's all good
" And but I it made for some really, really interesting reading"
" So I guess I just want to find out a little bit more about, I suppose, the things that you love about what you do"
 And I know that you've been involved in a lot of things around integrated care partnerships
 I really just want to find out a little bit more about you if that's okay
 And my apologies if this is the third time you've done this today
because I haven't actually heard that term yet
 That's the first time I've heard it
Yeah
 Wow
" So it almost sounds like a sort of little primary care mini hospital really, isn't it"
"Because there are just so many things that you've embraced, and it's really quite forward thinking"
Now it sounds really good
" I mean, I, I've kind of spent many years working Surrey, Sussex and South London"
" And it's amazing how many I've been doing this job for quite a while, but it's amazing how many surgeries I've just lost you on my screen there weren't you back"
" And it's amazing how many surgeries are still you know, you still got single GP practices, surgeries that do absolutely no extracurricular things at all whatsoever, so to hear what you do, and that's why I think it's so forward thinking because I think they so many areas and places that really really need to catch up"
" Have you found that it's kind of worked better for you, kind of this year with everything else that's going on"
 And people not baby being able to go to hospital and stuff
" Do you think it's really worked, you know, had an advantage"
I think that's the thing is we've had to find so many different ways of doing things in all aspects
" And in all areas haven't we, it it does sound like um, because I haven't heard of anybody doing obviously, I know that people hospitals do the drive throughs to the COVID"
" So for example, my dad had a hip replacement back in October"
 So he just went into a drive in COVID testing before his operation and all that kind of stuff
 So I know that the hospitals doing a lot of that
 But to hear GP surgeries doing that is really quite phenomenal
 I think
"Yeah, do you find because it just sounds just so I mean, I've got, I'm going off on a bit of a tangent here"
 And it might be the first time probably won't be the last
 But I've got parents who live just around the corner for me both with extensive health issues
" And I mean, admittedly, my our local surgery doesn't do as much as yours does"
" They do do a lot, and they are absolutely fantastic"
 Good
 But because of the things that they do
 It would I would love to see them
 I guess blossom is blossom the right word
 I don't know
 But I would love to see them blossom in the way that your your center obviously has
" Um, do you find that you"
" I mean, I guess you get to speak to people at conferences and all that kind of thing"
" Do you see what your center does as being quite, I suppose unique"
 Or are you finding more and more areas of doing that now
Always stopped at the money
" Yeah,"
"That's the thing, isn't it"
" But like you said, it's quite unusual though to have people kind of queuing up wanting to work with you because I know that in a lot of areas, recruitment is really difficult"
 I know a lot of areas have had real trouble recruiting practice pharmacists and clinical pharmacists actually haven't I think
"Yeah, no, that's really good"
 And if you've got any kind of special areas of interest yourself that you're able to fulfill because you've got this extended center
sounds brilliant sounds outside
" Well, all I can say"
" I'm just looking at the time so I'm conscious of your time as well, knowing that you've got another call at half past one"
 And I'd love to have a break in between
" and but it's been really interesting hearing about it, I'd love to see that happen across a lot more areas, because I think it is really innovative what you've done"
" And, and it'd be really nice to kind of see that happen on a much wider scale"
 So I could probably chat for ages
 But I will let you go and it's been really lovely to meet you and all but all be digitally but very nice to meet you
 And hopefully you get to have a nice rest after your next call
 I've been really chatting to you
"Yeah, he may indeed Look forward to it"
" Thank you, john"
 Okay
 Thank you
 Bye
