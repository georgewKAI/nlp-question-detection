"Nice to meet you, Dr"
" Ribchester, I hear you're very, very seasoned"
That's probably one of the better things then
"Okay, John, I will do well"
" So you know, we've got 15 minutes"
" And really, it's just a little bit of an experiment, of course, to see how we engage"
" But I think it was a really fabulous opportunity for me to just look at your account, you're obviously in a very large practice, which is a pcn of its own right"
" And your clinical director, so please tell me a little bit about how you manage anticoagulation"
 We know that the East Kent prescribing group guidance does recommend Apixaban
" Particuarly proberly clearence  are bleeding, and I think that's been updatedin May isnt it"
"In terms of the latest of NICE guidance, which you're aware of,when switching patients are wafarin"
 So how practices in your in your how is your PCN managing it
 And can you tell me a little bit about how they're doing
" Sure, yes,"
I have to say it sounds really smart
" But you know, quite impressive"
And she switched it
" Is there anything particularly I mean, from your practitioner perspective"
 Is there anything that you particularly like about apixarban
"I mean, that was going to be my next because I have had a couple of practice managers or GPS that i've spoken to saying to me, you know, there's a cohort of patients that we don't, don't want to switch over, because they're isolated, they're elderly, they need the contact, they want to come in and do you have sort of those sort of cohort of patients as well, or"
"And we know that sort of weird in terms of nice knife, they've got a sort of a estimation figure of people who are more often than not in their TTR"
 And that's about 47
1%
 And I just got some figures here for your practice
" And that's 140 of your patients that are, you know, timing through a therapeutic race"
 They're not in they're not appropriately anticoagulated
" And so that temporary, of those have a risk of stroke, high risk of stroke"
" So you know, there are figures that from a health point of view, even though you might have people that don't want to switch over there is a health risk for them this stroke bleeds depending which we show, you know, well,"
"you've actually got so this is some DPP data, you're aware of the detect, protect, protect agenda"
Unknown Speaker  6:49Yeah
 Yeah
So the detection is what are you doing around undiagnosed patients
 How do you detect at the moment
 What do you do
"yeah, detecting it,"
30 seconds
 Yeah
just a really something simple that the team can do that
" You know, whoever, you know, support staff, but also in terms you've got on your you've got 103 undetected, estimated undetected patients"
" But in terms of the protect cohort, these are people that are had to have a chance to or or at risk on a register somewhere, but not anticoagulated"
 And you there's an estimated of 177 patients there who are can be found in a register somewhere
 But I'm not giving any sort of DOAC or Wafarin
yeah
" And of course, if you wanted anyone of my team to go through this a little bit more detail after this call, we are very happy to do that with you and show you present you that data that I've got in front of me, but is a very interesting thing"
" And actually, that's about 15"
4%
" And in the region, it's about 16"
" So you are actually under the region, but national average is about 14"
 So the best performing region in England 6
"9%, which is amazing"
" So that's basically looking down your register, looking at the higher risk scores, the diabetes that have changed the chance of bath, basically, and identifying that they may well be at high risk"
"John, if you want some more support to do that any more information, we're very willing to set up a separate meeting and do that with your colleague"
" Works in East Kent, and I can pass it over as well"
What's your patient pathway Look at in your practice
 What are the sort of main touch points that you get somebody coming in
a say say AF somebodies just presenting with AF what is the pathway that they would take
"Brilliant, I'm going to go a little bit of peace, I'm going to just get off this subject, because actually, while I've got you here, I just want to get some insight off you"
 And that is really what is how can I word this
" Let's say, what is the easiest way for a rep like myself to get get in touch with the GP or practice manager"
And every every practice has a lead prescriber then do they
"Yeah, because you're quite a big practice"
" So I sometimes often think with the GPS tell practice managers don't take the calls, you know, because they're quite hard to understand their job, because really, you know, you've got all these reps calling them"
 And they're incredibly busy
 And this is a very difficult time anyway
 So this is
"Although I'm actually stroke as a key driver in the NHS long term plan and is based on data, you know, we can only present the fact in terms of compliance, you know, you know, I'm very conscious of the time, and I don't want to take any much more of your time, I really have enjoyed speaking to you"
" And if you really do want any more data to go through in your East Kent area, your particular practice, were very happy to do that"
 Thank you so much for your time
take care
 Bye
