QUERY
"Hi, Samantha, are you alright"
Thank you for joining joining me today
" Now I'm going to apologize in advance I woke up this morning with the most watching cold you can imagine medication at the moment and I've got, you know, pounding head and the blocked ears and sinuses and all that it's all going on today"
 I didn't want to cancel because I know it takes a lot of effort to organize and plan these thing
" So I plan to proceed as normal but if I stop and start sneezing or sniffling, I apologize"
"Well, I'm used to lots of background noise"
 I've got kids
" So, you know, don't worry about that in the slightest"
"You know what, I read an article yesterday about it was about a dog that had found his own electric blanket and had taken a shine to it was a greyhound, I think we see quite thin type of dog racing dog"
" It'd found that those electric blanket in the double beds that the owners had in the flat and they came in one morning, and they found it literally lying in the bed, pawr sticking out asleep, snoring, and they pitch in pitcher"
 That was the most hilarious thing ever and I just thought that was funny
"Oh, how many of you got by the way"
Yeah
" So and no, my fifteen year old daughter's been trying really hard for me to greet her to have a puppy because her dad, she goes every other weekend"
 He's got
" He's got three dogs, they've just got a third one and she's desperate to get a puppy and like I can't manage your puppy on top of everything else"
 You know what kids are like Mum I'll do everything
 Don't worry
 I'm like err no you won't I'll be the one cleanig it out and doing walks so not happening at the moment
I made that mistake with my children I went from two to three thinking it was no big deal and had another one but it's a lot harder
 Oh it's so funny
" Anyway, let me focus on what we're doing today"
Right
" Okay, so it's a, we've got probably about 10 minutes, not very long at the moment but the plan was to talk to you a bit about your role and for me to understand your bit better"
 Erm I'll probably just give you a brief overview of my role if that's okay with you and then we can kind of just see where the conversation leads
" So I'm Noren, I'm a network sales specialist in East London, northeast London at the moment"
" Currently in tier two, waiting to hear if we're moving to tier three, I look after Eliquis or Apixaban, which is a no act for reducing stroke"
 It no doubt I have patients
 So that's the product that I look after
" There were two as of last month, but literally only one product at the moment and I suppose from my point of view, erm so PCN clinical pharmacists are like an emerging a new, a new breed of super-pharmacies shall we say, and it's a really exciting, exciting time at the moment, because you're involved in lots of lots of different things"
 And I think what I'd like to do is get a better understanding of your role and kind of what your priorities are
" And also to find out a bit about what made you decide to do you know, the core 18 months and to go into that a bit further"
"So if you could do that, that would be brilliant"
Quite the saleswoman yeah
Don't mind me I'm jut making notes whilst your talking yeah
"Yeah, there behind closed doors arent they"
Yeah it does because doors were as compared to community pharmacies that will have a patient in front of them who might need some advice straight away they and have to think on the spot
"That's something I have found Samantha because when I worked in secondary care, and I did presentations to the pharmacists in secondary care, or in hospitals, they were more clued up with their clinical data, they wanted the ins and the outs of the data"
 They wanted me to take them through the set up of the trial and so on
 So they were definitely very engaged
 That's
"That was my next question actually, I was going to ask you, I did a bit of research and I realized that you fall under East PCN, which is one of seven, and I was going to ask you, but I just I has a little look at it and I was trying to work out"
 But what is your specific role within the practice that you're with at the moment
 Because my understanding is of two other clinical pharmacists as well
"I wanted to see, you've got big capacity haven't you in terms of you don't normally find that and why is that what do you do in that particular set up"
Alright okay
 I used to watch biker guys a long time ago not that that was very deprived
What do you enjoy most about your role
 At the moment
So it's about having that discussion and finding out what each person is doing within that particular practice
"I hope you wouldn't mind but I normally if I was meeting up with a customer I'd normally Google them and check their profile out look at what the background is and so on just because it helps me understand where we want to or what areas you want to discuss or focus on, and also it helps me you know, repore build or understand that person a bit better"
Yeah well all I can tell you about that is a hope they weren't from Pfizer and if they were I apolagies on their behalf as we were told from a company perspective that we're gonna cease all contact and the company have been absolutely brilliant that they haven't been putting pressure on the reps to go out and see this number of customers
" Because at the end of the day, we've got families around us that are suffering and struggling with COVID and it's about, it's about the human aspect of it and bring it to light forget about your day job"
" You've got people who were you know, we've had GPS in our local that we've known for years, who unfortunately have passed away with COVID"
" So it's about you know, what your what's important in terms of you and your values and the right thing to do at the right time"
 And I think everybody in here will advise it wasn't the right time to be engaging with customers
"And even though I'm quite cautious and you know, the impact of COVID has been huge, and it will be in the future as well for everybody"
" To the little kiddies down there who can't understand why their not at school to you know, elderly neighbors I've got who are like I can't see my family and friends and you know, are isolated on their own"
" So I spent my time my time in lockdown doing a lot of online learning a lot of research and doing a bit of baking as well, I must admit and dropping things off to my elderly neighbors like making dinner and dropping off food or making little handwritten cards with the kids and things like that just to lift their spirits up and that's continued even now and we haven't stopped doing that and I think that's, that's what COVID has brought out in a lot of people I think it's brought out the humanity side of things"
 And the little things make a big difference
" Yeah, that's my personal feelings about it all erm but I think we're gonna have to close at the moment, isn't it"
 Are their any questions you would like to ask me at all
You've got a busy old morning haven't you you've got three of my colleagues straight after this
"Okay, brilliant"
 Thank you so much for your time it's been a really useful talk about your role
 And I shall use it to help me better understand the relationships that I build with the clinical pharmacists in my area
" And you're right I've come across perscribers this already, and I've met a few that are very early on in their career and just starting to get that confidence and build it up"
 So it's great to hear from somebody who's right at the top of their game
 Good luck to you in the future I hope it goes well
" Thank you, and have a good afternoon"
 Take care
Bye bye
