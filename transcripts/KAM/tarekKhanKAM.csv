"Absolutely, john"
 Thanks for all the time
" Really, really appreciate that"
 And I think with my name is obviously Tariq Khan
 I'm a senior network sales specialist for Pfizer in Birmingham
" Yeah, so totally opposite of where you are"
"yeah, still there"
" And I think with everything going on at the moment, Pfizer has been really busy"
" And I mean, how are you coping at the moment with the all the pandemic that's going around you"
Yeah
 busy
" But hopefully, we will have a more positive New Year to start with, I'm hoping after a very difficult, challenging year for all of us, Indeed, indeed, for the whole world human race, to be honest, not just us guys here"
" So yeah, there you go"
" But yeah, thanks again, for your time today"
 And I know you're busy
" And I appreciate all the time that you've given us, and what I wanted to do to have a discussion around how we can work in collaboration in partnership around some of the common themes that we can derive from this conversation moving forward"
" And it could be around pathways, it could be around protocols, service redesign, or even cost savings, to be honest in the world that we are a moment"
" And just to mention, I promote apixaban for stroke in nonvalvular atrial fibrillation"
 I've just mentioned that
 And obviously Tracy has mentioned the point that this call is being recorded
 So we're fine with that
" So first and foremost, I think also, I'd also like to ask um, because I understand that you're also a clinical director of strategy"
 Is that correct
Wow
 Okay
" As long as that,"
Thats good to know
 It's great that you're giving me this insight
" It's wonderful, because I can take this forward, you know, and use this information to really plan ahead, you know, because you guys have done a really wonderful job"
" You're very proactive, very engaging from what I'm understanding, and you want that integrated system to work effectively"
Wonderful
 Thank you
 Thank you for that
It's like a riff test
 Appreciate that really helps
" I mean, one or two questions that come out of that"
" Basically The first one's gonna be the obvious one for myself, how can we actually support you even more, as I suppose a PCN a CCG, the way you're moving forward, obviously, you are proactive, very engaging, when you've got your strategy in place, in line with the five year strategy"
 So what else can we do more as Pfizer
"Yeah, of course"
" No, thank you for that"
" And and, you know, that's food for thought for me to take back to my colleagues, in terms of what actions and how can we actually support you with that the education piece"
 Absolutely
" I totally agree with the education, you can get never enough of it"
" And obviously, we've got 25 hcps, in your pcn"
" And obviously, education is a need for transplant"
 So that's something I can look what my colleagues can look with you
 And to plan that out
 Definitely
" Obviously, you mentioned pathway development"
 Yes
" I mean, I'm sure we can get some examples of pathway develop"
 I'm sure your pathways are very effective
" But obviously, we can always grow and improve upon"
 Absolutely
" So that's something we can hopefully share with yourself, and good examples of some countries"
" And I think he also mentioned about the cost modeling, we do have a tool, which is called a prime cost modeling tool"
" And basically one of my colleagues use CEC, which is a clinical effective consultant"
 And they look at the health economics
" So what they look at is the cost comparison between the doacs obviously, working strat prevention, in terms of a couple years in terms of what savings you can make, how effective the drug is"
 So there's comparisons with that I can make
" So that's a separate thing that we can actually, obviously engage with yourself on that too"
" So there's a couple of things we can stay away work on the three things that you mentioned was education, profit development, and obviously, the cost"
" modeling tool began, definitely, and I think, yeah, and the other point, I just wanted to quickly, I think mentioned was that you mentioned the DVT"
" The program that you've got set up, which is wonderful"
" And I think you also do the INR monitoring,I believe"
"Brilliant, brilliant, fantastic"
 I think we've had a good discussion there
" Actually, we could go on and on"
" But the thing is, I think there's some fantastic insights that you've given me, Dr"
 ribchester
" And obviously, some things for me to work on with my colleagues"
 Is there anything else that you'd like to add me before I go
 Is there any other support
" I mean, we do have our website Pfizer dot co dot UK, and what we, I mean, you can go on there"
" And basically, it basically tells you some of the resources that we have some of the programs that we've been involved with the medical education grant service"
" So it's got a lot on there Pfizer dot co dot UK, just type that in, And but yeah, I mean, like I say, you know, we've had a really, I found a really robust, and a very fruitful conversation"
yeah
" Yeah, yeah, of course, I've noted it down, actually, to talk to my colleague about that"
" I mean, obviously, it's a need, you know, for the students"
" And, you know, if you want to grow those students, the thing is, it's about as we say, you know, okay, we don't have a plan for it"
" So having that discussion with yourself, what that looks like that journey, you know, from what's the objective, the goal, and in terms of how can we actually plan that out"
 Definitely
" So yeah, that's something for me to take it back to along with the other things that we mentioned regarding this Community Learning Hub"
" Definitely, I noted all that man"
thank you
 And it's lovely speaking to you and thank you for your time again
you take a look after yourself
 Okay
 Take care
 Bye for now
Bye
