"Hillary Hi, I would Oh, thank you very much, Hillary"
 My name is Dawn
 And I obviously work for Pfizer
 I actually promote Eliquis for non valvular AF
" So in the in the arena of anticoagulation, just so that you know what I do I actually work on the area that covers your geography in your area, as well"
 So it's lovely to meet you
 I live a lot further south
 I live from south of the tyne
 Right
 So I'm right down below below the tyne
" But yeah, it's lovely to meet you"
" So so I'm just hoping we and or we can just, we would normally share things on the screen"
" And obviously, we can't do that today"
" So I just wondered if if, you know, well, first of all, Has everybody been okay due to the COVID"
 And how are you getting on with all of that
Okay
" Ah, so, so it is it"
 So you feel like you've been thrown a lot of different challenges this year
"Yeah, it's hard, isn't it through the winter"
" So yeah, so So that said, we, you know, obviously, the conversation we can have is about maybe we can support you in some areas"
" And I don't know if in your role, and if you could let me know if there's anything that you feel we could support you"
" We are obviously looking at anticoagulation, and particularly some of the national policy work that can go on around detects protects perfect in that area"
 Yeah
 Have you heard of that one
" And so, you know, obviously, we've got various resources"
" And I don't know where you're at with with that locally with that agenda, or is it has it changed"
Yeah
 Yeah
"Yes, they do"
" Yes, they do"
 Yeah
 Yeah
 So it's it
" Yes, you're right"
 It's moving it from just a warfarin service to an actual anticoagulation service
 Yeah
 So yeah
" So wherever, you know, you've got to with that, you know, I don't know whether there's may be some areas we can help, you know, certain surgeries with"
" There's all sorts of things, maybe even prioritizing the numbers if they haven't quite looked at them yet, you know, at a local level, and, and maybe ensure the benefit of the outcomes for the patients that prioritize those those numbers and how to just incorporate that into the normal practice pharmacist review"
 And that might already be going on
" And we've got things like we've got, we've gone virtual as much as we can, and going down that road well as like to say, so we have things like patient leaflets that are available online now"
" And obviously, there's education, if anybody wanted any, getting on the usual, you know, local constant, permanent upskilling, or just just upskilling on things like dosing and as you say monitoring and what the requirements are, etc"
" So, you know, you'll be in a position to know if there are practices that might benefit from that or Yeah"
 Anything you think we could help with
Right
 Okay
" Yeah, yes"
" Yeah, do it outside of the normal work"
 So you don't you don't see it
 Yeah
" So it's a separate piece of work, you don't see it as something that's going to be done within the normal realms of say that, say the review practice the pharmacist, etc, that are going on"
Yeah
 Yeah
 So yeah
" So you're right at the beginning, really, of trying to work out how we're going to go forward into next year with the DPP thing really,"
detects protects prevents
So you're right at the beginning of that is thinking about next year for the long term plan
Yeah
 Because it was doing so well
" Everything was gone along quite so well on on preventative, and all sorts of areas wasnt it"
 Not just cardiovascular but everything
balancing it
 Yeah
 Yeah
" So as well we do have we do have sort of things I said that I would have shown you that kind of highlight the you know, the the by optimizing that management in the detect, etc, you know how the benefits to the patient prevention etc"
" And then the follow on benefit, obviously, of the cost of the patient of having a stroke and the wider health care cost of having a stroke"
" So we've got all of that, that we could share with you in a different on a different day"
" And also, you know, colleagues who colleague who have other kind of computer models, if you like that, you know, help you to look at patient pathways and prioritize in terms of what the outcomes are in terms of quality metric"
" So there's a few different different colleagues that we have that if we were interested, we could bring in and just to show you and give you a flavor of what to do when a piece of work would, could result in and it kind of when you're sort of pushed, as you say, for choosing resource and and balancing that it might help you to do that"
" Yes, or we can, you know, but obviously, we can't do that today"
 I can't share
" And then as I say this, the other the other issue of the on the ground support, if there was anybody else that you thought would benefit from a conversation around, you know, with the actual direct data, monitoring the lift to the doors, and etc"
 And so there's a few different things
"Yes, I have supported those in the past until this year, we've missed them"
"yeah, well done"
 But do you think you're gonna do them like that in the future
"Tt does it has done we've done that as well with in I see what your saying about training, we've had consult we now do sort of consultants speaking"
" And, you know all times of the day, you know, early morning lunchtime, like after work, and it does seem to suit some people, you can put things on at different times, give them a couple of different opportunities to listen"
" And so yeah, so yes, on from that side, yes, we can sort of source you know, the local, you know, specialist in that area"
" If, and, obviously, we've got to go through some compliance, hoops, and all of that, and, you know, do it all properly"
" But yes, we can get the consultant to maybe, if it wasn't a therapy area that you felt would know, they would benefit from a talk and an interactive sort of session with"
 Yeah
"Yes, that's right"
" We've had more we've had more interaction from sort of up and down the country to things, you know, you normally wouldn't obviously, um and then people can also dip in and dip out, as they say, it's not the commitment to travel or be there for the whole afternoon is not there anymore, is it"
 It's you could dip into that section that is relevant to you
 So to have something else that maybe we can think about to work together on and for next year
 If you think there's something we can support
 Yeah
 Yeah
" Yeah, that would be good"
"short, sharp"
 Yeah
" Yeah, yeah"
 And everybody's getting very good
" Get very good at the tech and the digital capability, aren't we"
"Nor do you know what I have such a funny, I live near the city center near Newcastle city centre and my internet is dreadful phone the IT guy and he'll say what do you live in rural"
" I'm saying no, no"
 City Centre
 I've got dreadful internet
" So no, it's really difficult"
 Isn't it
" Really, really difficult"
 Yeah
" Oh, sorry"
" I think oh, I don't know if our time is up"
 And I still hear somebody speaking there
 I don't know
" No, Tracy there"
" No, she's not there"
 I thought I heard somebody in the background
" Oh, dear"
 So so yes
 And that will be great
 If maybe we catch up again
 Yeah
" And see, and see where we're at and sought out for next year about some what you're going to do next year"
" That's really interesting, isn't it with"
 So so everything else that you're doing
" It's really difficult, isn't it to balance"
" And all I can say is when I've spoken to other people in other areas, they're finding the same story, isn't it"
 It's hard to juggle everything and prioritize
 Yeah
 And so hopefully we can we can be of support with some of that
 Going into next year
 Yeah
Are you there trace
Are you there
 Tracy
 She's gone
 She's gone
 Because I know you've got another call in five minutes
 I wanted to give you a little bit of time
"It is awful, isn't it"
" And you know, it happens it all it happens often on the WebEx and I don't know really why"
 And also is is he suddenly then it suddenly works
" And you think, oh, what did I do there"
"Well, because we always do a practice run"
 And then we do the practice run and it works
" And the next day it doesn't, you know, it's a little bit a little bit frustrating"
 But do you use teams and things as well
"yeah, it is it is a funny, it's a funny thing to get used to, I think this is part of this thing that we're doing now is trying to make us better at it"
" It's also the opportunity to practice as well, because surgeries are so busy on the That's it, we haven't had huge amounts of opportunities"
" So it's it's it's difficult, as you say, we're going to be working like this"
" Do you see this continuing into next year, this virtual working more than even once things have settled a little bit"
"Yeah, caution until next year, all the way through"
" So yeah, yes"
" It's how to how to manage, as you say these, the clinics and the getting the patients through Yeah"
"Because they've got because the CBD thing does come into the into it next year, doesn't it"
" The long term plan, you know, and you'll have those milestones to reach"
 Will you those those goals to reach
yes
 Yeah
"it's really tricky, really difficult, yet really difficult"
" So it seems like really what we need to try and do is help you to, to do what you need to do within the realms of your current resource Don't we and try and support you as much as we can"
" Yeah, sort of hope for that would be nice to be able to do some of that"
" Throughout the time out, as you say across the across the Federation"
 We can maybe help with some education and stuff
 Yeah
 Good
 Be good
 Yeah
" Oh, and then there's Christmas to get sorted out"
 Isn't there
 got to get past Christmas
 Are you doing a socially distant Christmas
yes
 Different
