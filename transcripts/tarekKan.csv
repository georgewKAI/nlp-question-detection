HCP,Please call me john
HCP," And can I call you, Tariq"
KAM,"Absolutely, john"
KAM, Thanks for all the time
KAM," Really, really appreciate that"
KAM, And I think with my name is obviously Tariq Khan
KAM, I'm a senior network sales specialist for Pfizer in Birmingham
KAM," Yeah, so totally opposite of where you are"
HCP,"Exactly, I always associate Pfizer with them with sandwich because, yes, its shrunk a bit, but it's still there"
KAM,"yeah, still there"
KAM," And I think with everything going on at the moment, Pfizer has been really busy"
KAM," And I mean, how are you coping at the moment with the all the pandemic that's going around you"
HCP,"Well I think the same as any other large general practice, PCN, you know, we had to change completely everything"
HCP," You know, we've just created a COVID virtual Ward, which involves giving out pulse oximeters to detect silent hypoxia"
HCP, And we're just cranking up to be part of the mass immunization program
HCP," So, yeah, so it's all pretty, pretty busy and completely changed, as it has for everybody"
KAM,Yeah
KAM, busy
KAM," But hopefully, we will have a more positive New Year to start with, I'm hoping after a very difficult, challenging year for all of us, Indeed, indeed, for the whole world human race, to be honest, not just us guys here"
KAM," So yeah, there you go"
KAM," But yeah, thanks again, for your time today"
KAM, And I know you're busy
KAM," And I appreciate all the time that you've given us, and what I wanted to do to have a discussion around how we can work in collaboration in partnership around some of the common themes that we can derive from this conversation moving forward"
KAM," And it could be around pathways, it could be around protocols, service redesign, or even cost savings, to be honest in the world that we are a moment"
KAM," And just to mention, I promote apixaban for stroke in nonvalvular atrial fibrillation"
KAM, I've just mentioned that
KAM, And obviously Tracy has mentioned the point that this call is being recorded
KAM, So we're fine with that
KAM," So first and foremost, I think also, I'd also like to ask um, because I understand that you're also a clinical director of strategy"
KAM, Is that correct
HCP,Yeah I've got several titles
HCP, It's a little bit embarrassing
HCP, I'm GP director of strategy for Whitstable medical practice which is a single practice PCN
HCP," I'm also the PCN, clinical director"
HCP, I do some work with the East Kent ICP as well
HCP, So I've got like a lot of us quite a few titles
HCP," I'm also on the foundation board for the newly founded Kenton memory medical school, which went live September"
HCP," So yeah, like a lot of people"
HCP, I've got a few hats
HCP,Okay
HCP, All right
HCP," Well, I mean, we came to being a PCN from the encompass MCP MCP's"
HCP, We're multi professional clinical providers
HCP," Yeah, which was really Simon Stephens ideas, the three year project"
HCP," They were I think nine MCP's and encompass was one of them which I which I chaired and Western medical practice, I think it's fair to say was the heart of that and it actually involved Canterbury Herne Bay Whitstable fathom, not by sorry, whistle favish wing mash sandwich"
HCP," So we looked after about 180,000 people in for what we called hubs, and on the evidence of our MCP, and indeed others up and down the country, the concept of of PCN's was born and what one common thing is a community multidisciplinary team"
HCP," Yeah, the product of which is producing an anticipatory care plan for frail people, typically elderly people, and I use the word anticipatory because yeah, just about the care plan for the here and now"
HCP," It's where inevitably, unfortunately, their condition or conditions worse and what do we do there"
HCP," And yes, absolutely"
HCP,"And some people surprised us by saying, I don't actually want to go to hospital, you know, I'm 89"
HCP, I'm gonna stay here
HCP, Thank you and take my chances with you guys
HCP," And it also by creating multidisciplinary teams with one version of the electronic care record, there's much more coordination one version of the truth, one up to date version, rather than every agency having their own version of the of the record"
HCP, And so the transition to from an MCP with hubs to a PCN was a natural transition because return to the former informed the latter so that was quite easy
HCP," The new challenges involve trying to apart quite often COVID of course, and involve trying to engage with the the PCN enhance service, which is Yeah, the sort of a must do at least it is actually voluntary"
HCP," But yeah, you got to start somewhere, you got to start there"
HCP," But most PCN's that are forward thinking, and I hope ours is also a five year strategy written"
HCP," And in our case, that involves trying to develop an awful lot more community integrated healthcare"
HCP," Yeah, is"
HCP," I don't know if you know much about Western medical practice, but we've sort of pioneered this from Blimey, 20 years ago"
KAM,Wow
KAM, Okay
KAM," As long as that,"
HCP,"yeah, the concept of hospitals over there in general practice over here always seem mad to me"
HCP," You know, we're one driver medical school"
HCP, Let me turn into two tribes when we get out Yeah
HCP, And qualified
HCP," So we've, we've, we've developed a range of services over a number of years, which you'd normally associate with a trip to hospitals"
HCP," So we have an urgent treatment center with with a full DVT diagnosis and treatment service, ultrasound open six days a week, which actually beats the hospital"
HCP, And we do use apixaban for that
HCP, We're in the same camp already
HCP," But I mean, that that that is we are the only community provider of a community DVT diagnosis and treatment service in wonderful Kent"
HCP," And our lead ACP advanced care practitioner nurse has done a master's in thromboembolism, so embarrassed to say she knows more than the rest of us now"
HCP, So that's good
HCP, But we also have a range of diagnostics
HCP, We have a range of outpatients
HCP, We have an operating theatre where cataract surgery and skin surgery is done
HCP," So we're very much moved into urgent care and elective care of the sort you'd normally have to go to hospital for for a day case or an outpatient, such that more than 50% of our turnover is now community integrated healthcare, the other 50% being GMS"
HCP, So we're a bit of an outlier in that respect
HCP," But it is similar where we were actually in NHS Pathfinder, when there were pathfinders, and it seemed very much as the way forward to try and integrate, rather than have, as I've said, secondary, primary care over here"
HCP," So our challenges as long as to your short question, I apologize"
HCP, our Challenges
KAM,Thats good to know
KAM, It's great that you're giving me this insight
KAM," It's wonderful, because I can take this forward, you know, and use this information to really plan ahead, you know, because you guys have done a really wonderful job"
KAM," You're very proactive, very engaging from what I'm understanding, and you want that integrated system to work effectively"
HCP,"We do indeed, so so our challenge in a nutshell is not really enhanced service, we find that quite easy"
HCP," The challenge is trying to fulfill the the aspirations in our five in our five year strategy with involves developing more outpatients, more diagnostics"
HCP," And yeah, and working hard in the in the urgent care sector as well use the urgent treatment center where we now have, as I say, we we have this DVT service, we have virtual and face to face fracture clinics there"
HCP," And we have a range of point of care blood tests now as well, quite apart from D-dimer, which we've had for four or five years now we can now do lots of other point of care blood tests"
HCP, And the principle is really to try to give patients the best possible experience and to not overload secondary care with stuff we can do in the community
HCP," And we recognize that as PCNs move forward and develop, there will probably be a move towards PCN level budgets for urgent care and secondary care"
HCP," I mean, some areas of England have already got this"
HCP," I mean, in east Kent is getting there in terms of activity, but they haven't got as far as costing it yet"
HCP," But I can see the writing on the wall, you know that the the good PCN's will be rewarded with investment, that those that are lasting a fortune will probably get nothing more than whatever the baseline is"
HCP," I see change coming with pcn being the unit of delivery in the community, but also becoming the unit of currency in the next few years"
KAM,Wonderful
KAM, Thank you
KAM, Thank you for that
KAM,It's like a riff test
KAM, Appreciate that really helps
KAM," I mean, one or two questions that come out of that"
KAM," Basically The first one's gonna be the obvious one for myself, how can we actually support you even more, as I suppose a PCN a CCG, the way you're moving forward, obviously, you are proactive, very engaging, when you've got your strategy in place, in line with the five year strategy"
KAM, So what else can we do more as Pfizer
HCP,"I think your general principles, you know, in areas where you're where you have an interest, obviously, to help with an education and pathway government is actually really helpful"
HCP," I mean, I haven't mentioned that that, you know, there's there's 25 GPS in the western medical practice, which is the pcn before COVID"
HCP," We had fortnightly clinical meetings, which we used for developing pathways, sometimes external speakers, sometimes internal speakers"
HCP," And that was really appreciated not just by the GPS, but the nursing and paramedics that we employ, we also employ two pharmacists to one pharmacy assistant as well"
HCP, So the idea of this becoming a rich learning environment
HCP," Now, of course, we've become a community hub for Yeah, I can't remember in medical school"
HCP, So the whole concept of being a learning organization is very much close to our heart
HCP," So any help with that, from, you know, a company that has an interest in a drug that we will be using, you know, picks around being an obvious one"
HCP," And then yes, that's very helpful"
HCP, So that that that's in general terms
HCP," I mean, within that, you know, the idea of cost modeling can be helpful, because, yes, the most obvious thing that the CCGs can monitor about PCN's, yeah, is drugs bed"
HCP," There's the easiest thing to monitor really, yeah"
HCP, And they are already monitoring that very closely
HCP," And we get, we did get quarterly reports on how we were doing and how we're doing compared to our our neighbors, and Kent and a nation"
HCP," So all of that side of things, I think will be monitored pretty closely as time goes on once the crisis of COVID"
HCP," But, you know, because simply because it's so easy to monitor"
KAM,"Yeah, of course"
KAM," No, thank you for that"
KAM," And and, you know, that's food for thought for me to take back to my colleagues, in terms of what actions and how can we actually support you with that the education piece"
KAM, Absolutely
KAM," I totally agree with the education, you can get never enough of it"
KAM," And obviously, we've got 25 hcps, in your pcn"
KAM," And obviously, education is a need for transplant"
KAM, So that's something I can look what my colleagues can look with you
KAM, And to plan that out
KAM, Definitely
KAM," Obviously, you mentioned pathway development"
KAM, Yes
KAM," I mean, I'm sure we can get some examples of pathway develop"
KAM, I'm sure your pathways are very effective
KAM," But obviously, we can always grow and improve upon"
KAM, Absolutely
KAM," So that's something we can hopefully share with yourself, and good examples of some countries"
KAM," And I think he also mentioned about the cost modeling, we do have a tool, which is called a prime cost modeling tool"
KAM," And basically one of my colleagues use CEC, which is a clinical effective consultant"
KAM, And they look at the health economics
KAM," So what they look at is the cost comparison between the doacs obviously, working strat prevention, in terms of a couple years in terms of what savings you can make, how effective the drug is"
KAM, So there's comparisons with that I can make
KAM," So that's a separate thing that we can actually, obviously engage with yourself on that too"
KAM," So there's a couple of things we can stay away work on the three things that you mentioned was education, profit development, and obviously, the cost"
KAM," modeling tool began, definitely, and I think, yeah, and the other point, I just wanted to quickly, I think mentioned was that you mentioned the DVT"
KAM," The program that you've got set up, which is wonderful"
KAM," And I think you also do the INR monitoring,I believe"
HCP,"We do yes, I mean, I suppose most people on anticoagulants of some sort"
HCP," Are people with AF, that's probably the biggest cohort"
HCP," Yeah, the DVT service is not just for our PCN, like any other UTC or virtually, anybody from anywhere can walk in"
HCP," And we probably serve about population about 200,000"
HCP," And in fact, for the DVT service, probably even further afield than that, yeah, our service is more accessible than the hospital based service"
HCP," Yeah, and the time between decision to have an ultrasound and actually having an ultrasound is usually one or two days"
HCP," In the hospital, it can be 10 days or more"
HCP," And our colleagues, our GP colleagues that is around these kind of recognize this and they'd much rather get a patient diagnosed quickly and have them on low molecular weight heparin for 10 days or more, waiting to have an ultrasound to tell them they haven't got DVT anyway, which is yeah, it's not good for the patient, and it's actually a waste of money"
HCP," So,"
KAM,"Brilliant, brilliant, fantastic"
KAM, I think we've had a good discussion there
KAM," Actually, we could go on and on"
KAM," But the thing is, I think there's some fantastic insights that you've given me, Dr"
KAM, ribchester
KAM," And obviously, some things for me to work on with my colleagues"
KAM, Is there anything else that you'd like to add me before I go
KAM, Is there any other support
KAM," I mean, we do have our website Pfizer dot co dot UK, and what we, I mean, you can go on there"
KAM," And basically, it basically tells you some of the resources that we have some of the programs that we've been involved with the medical education grant service"
KAM," So it's got a lot on there Pfizer dot co dot UK, just type that in, And but yeah, I mean, like I say, you know, we've had a really, I found a really robust, and a very fruitful conversation"
HCP,"Okay, well, thank you for that"
HCP," I mean, it gave me a thing, and it's really an open question is not not really a specific suggestion is that the certainly intent this this medical school is is a hot topic for us"
HCP," Okay, never had a medical school"
HCP," It's the largest accounting, not the medical school, okay"
HCP, And it's a new venture for us
HCP," Topic teaching the students, we've had medical students, junior doctors of every grade, paramedics, for years"
HCP," And it's a this is a different way of training, because the training, the other grades I've just mentioned, it's whatever patient comes into the room, you talk about them"
HCP," The concept of the medical school is completely different than if they are in the medical school doing a specific topic, you know, renal, cardiac, respiratory, they want their students taught the same thing in general practice at the same time"
HCP," Now, that's an interesting challenge"
HCP," And so getting together, any sort of help for medical students would certainly go down extremely well with the Dean of KMS"
HCP, But it may well help these community community Learning hubs such as ours
HCP, Yeah
HCP, work in a slightly different way
HCP," I haven't got a specific suggestion on that Tariq but its just a thought,"
KAM,yeah
KAM," Yeah, yeah, of course, I've noted it down, actually, to talk to my colleague about that"
KAM," I mean, obviously, it's a need, you know, for the students"
KAM," And, you know, if you want to grow those students, the thing is, it's about as we say, you know, okay, we don't have a plan for it"
KAM," So having that discussion with yourself, what that looks like that journey, you know, from what's the objective, the goal, and in terms of how can we actually plan that out"
KAM, Definitely
KAM," So yeah, that's something for me to take it back to along with the other things that we mentioned regarding this Community Learning Hub"
KAM," Definitely, I noted all that man"
HCP,"Okay, well, thanks"
HCP, very brilliant
HCP," No,"
KAM,thank you
KAM, And it's lovely speaking to you and thank you for your time again
HCP,and speaking to you Tariq
KAM,you take a look after yourself
KAM, Okay
KAM, Take care
KAM, Bye for now
KAM,Bye
