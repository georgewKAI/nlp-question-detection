KAM,"Hillary, thank you so much"
KAM, I'm just going to click this button
KAM, It just says that I'm the host for the meeting
KAM," Thank you, it's been a pleasure to have this opportunity to catch up with you just to let me remind you, I'm sure you've heard this a million times today it is being recorded for training purposes, but I've been told that I need to say that just to kind of kick the presentation off"
KAM, How are you are you alright
HCP,"Yes, yes yeah, all good in tier three, what tier are you in"
HCP, whereabouts
KAM,So we're in tier two
KAM," So to be honest, it's a good way to reflect and keep your distance from everyone and just when Christmas comes, and we're allowed to mingle a bit freely, I'm so looking forward to it"
KAM, I'm sure you're probably the same
KAM," Yeah, have you done, Have you done any of your Christmas shopping yet"
KAM, Or you're gonna wait to
HCP,And I've tried to do it
HCP, And I really am trying to buy more from small businesses
HCP," And yes,"
KAM,I'm with you absolutely
HCP,So there's a really good Facebook page called not on Amazon
HCP, And there's some really good
KAM,"Oh I've not heard of, Funny I know, there's not on the high street"
KAM,com which we tend to buy a little bit from and they're lovely and bespoke
KAM," But no, I'm gonna have a look at that one actually not on, I' actually going to jot that down"
KAM," Because, like you said, it's so important to support our local businesses, then the big ones are going to thrive, but the little ones are all going to go under"
KAM, And they're under so much pressure right now as well
KAM, Not on Amazon
KAM," I don't know who came up with that name, but I love it"
KAM, Not on everything
KAM, Not on Amazon
KAM, Did you say sorry
HCP,Yes
HCP, Not on Amazon
KAM,Yeah
KAM, Love it
KAM, Love it
KAM, Fabulous
KAM, Fantastic
KAM, So I'm definitely going to be looking out for that
KAM," Hillary, I'm gonna keep an eye on the time, because I've been told I've got to keep a strict eye on the time, because I know that you've got other commitments to get to get to as well"
KAM, So I'll be respectful of that
KAM," And so in tier three, does that mean that you can't mingle with anybody"
KAM, Or is it shut down after 10
KAM, Or
HCP,"so all small shops are open, no restaurants or pubs are all in It can't socialise, can't mix households"
HCP, So
KAM,"Oh my god, so its you know, oh that's terrible"
KAM, But you got to look at the bigger picture
KAM," I know, it's, it's not great for people that are being isolated and individuals that are being isolated that are on their own, but it's for the greater good"
KAM," And I guess, having that in the background makes it just a little bit acceptable"
KAM, And just understanding a little bit more
HCP,"Yeah and I think and now that vaccines are coming in, we'll be starting with those"
HCP,I think that really helps
KAM,That will be amazing thatll be so nice
KAM, And then our fingers crossed and go back to what was always been normal for us
KAM," And it's been so so hard to I guess COVID is still having quite a strong presence where you are, and How does, how does that kind of impact the way that you work"
KAM, And has it had an impact in your role
HCP,"And not so, well"
HCP, I suppose what the impact that it has on my role is mean that I'd be much more remote working
HCP,"So which is in a way good, and it means you can actually attend board meetings, which isn't necessarily a good thing"
HCP, So yeah
HCP," But in the area that I work so I'm work as management lead for West Northumberland primary care network, and I'm also manager of Hadrian primary care alliance, which is in the GP Federation"
HCP," So yeah, so where we are is a huge geographic area"
HCP," So when we were having PCN board meetings, which we still are, but we're going to monthly, but when we used to meet face to face, we used to rotate amongst the practices, but that sometimes can mean traveling for up to an hour to get there"
HCP," And so, you know, the two hour meeting become four hours of the time needed"
HCP," Yeah, it's more efficient"
HCP," And yeah, yeah, I mean, has it has changed"
HCP," I mean, certainly, I think a lot of the practices, you know, it's really accelerated these are digital technologies"
KAM,"For every every industry, I think, has adopted the digital environment is the only way to be at the moment because we've lost that face to face personal interaction that we used to have and we take for granted"
KAM," It's really interesting that your role is sorry, I've just jotted down a few things"
KAM," You're not your role is very unique, because you've got the Federation on one side, one side of it, you've got the PCN kind of on another side, how do they, I mean, do do the parties always marry up with a completely different to one another"
HCP,"Um it can be challenging at times and sometimes amazing thinking,"
KAM,absolutely
HCP,I know something about this
HCP," I can't say anything because in the context of my call, and it's not people, I think where were the difference is and and we differ in terms of it's not the same footprint in terms of practices"
HCP," So a lot, certainly we've got two practices in the area"
HCP, So there's 14 practices in the locality
HCP," And 11 of them are members of the Federation 12 members of the PCN and two, but they're not always the same"
HCP, Two aren't members of a PCN
KAM,Oh Wow
HCP,"And so I think where they difference really is, is, as a PCN, It's allowed, like, from what you're mandated to do, or what you have to deliver is very much directed by NHS England at the moment"
HCP, Yeah
HCP, Yeah
HCP," So it's about delivering the network contract days, and all those elements of it"
HCP, Yeah
HCP," Whereas from a federation perspective, we can do whatever we want to do"
HCP," So at the moment, we sort of have a range of services, including one wafarin monitoring one, which isn't financially isn't very feasible isn't finacially viable really, but because it's the DOAC's"
HCP," But because we live in such a rural area, it's really important that the services are kept close to the patient"
HCP," So keeping that service going, because otherwise it'd be too difficult for patients to have to go to the hospital or whatever"
HCP, Yeah
KAM,"And Hillary, can I ask you, did you say is the Federation that icon that are of the Federation, could you can kind of take responsibility and do what it is that they want"
KAM, Are they the one that served the wafarin services being kind of looked at with the Federation and not with the PCN
HCP,No
HCP, So the federal the Federation has the see the wolf and the wafarin monitoring contracts
HCP," So we've been, we've been commissioned, we were commissioned to do that god several years ago now as part of AQP any qualified provider contract"
HCP," And so I think six of the practices do so we buy their licenses, I do all the contract monitoring, and six practices provide the service to the patients"
KAM,Yeah
KAM, Are you finding that with with the the wafarin killing that scene contracted at the moment
KAM," Are you finding it difficult for patients to do their own arms because of, you know, lack of interaction and coming to the six surgeries to kind of have their own arm checks"
HCP,"So no, because it was one of the services that we got notification very quickly of that that is being continued"
HCP, So it was a must do service to continue
HCP," And, obviously, I think there was a process of by all practices when they were providing the service, I'm not really moving as many people as possible from from wafarin onto a DOAC"
HCP,"But obviously, there's still a small number of people who can't move, and you will continue to service for"
KAM,Sure
KAM, So Hillary so I'm not sure if you're aware of the role that Pfizer play
KAM," So I work with Pfizer, I work with primary care"
KAM," We work with PCN, we promote apixaban"
KAM," And I guess where that would kind of I mean, how did you see yourselves being part of the part of the Federation, but equally being a PCN management lead"
KAM, How do how does it work
KAM, How do you see yourselves working with with the pharma industry
HCP,I think it's an interesting one
HCP," And I think as a federation, we have tended to work with pharmaceutical industry in an exact meeting on Thursday, and we're looking to develop a sort of a position statement of policy, because I think it depends on who you work with, and any sort of GPS you're dealing with"
HCP," I think there's lots of opportunities, and I think at PCN level"
HCP, I think it all depends on your clinical director
HCP," So for example, our clinical director comes from a practice that traditionally has been really don't anything to do with the pharma industry"
KAM,Okay
KAM, Yeah
HCP,"And that's a very different approach to well, you sort of so I'm trying to get that actually, that's maybe a reflection of you as a person but not necessarily relfection of the whole, but we do need to start thinking about their position statement for the PCN, as well as the Federation"
HCP, So I think there's lots more flexibilities around the Federation
HCP," So where we worked with the pharma industry, on a lot of things, actually"
HCP," And we research we have a research contracts away, and we do a lot work with it"
HCP," We've also do industry studies, and we do timeout events and they've always been traditionally Sponsored by pharma, the pharma industry several, several"
HCP," And so it's just about now formalizing what we what our position to be going forward, I think is still, and I don't think people realize how strongly regulators, the pharmaceutical industry is, and I think there's still a perception that about a free lunch and you mean your behavior will be affected by clean"
HCP, And so I think there's lots of lots of opportunities
HCP, And I'm very conscious sort of over the last since COVID been a lot more training and opportunities to and a lot of those have been funded by pharmaceutical industry
HCP," And, and if you're part of my role is sort of getting some GPS on on side to actually say, actually, it's not like that CO in terms of, they can't promote their own products, or whatever"
HCP," But there's still a perception, I think amongst Yeah"
KAM,"Yeah, it's a shame because some people have moved on, and some haven't"
KAM," And, like you said, We are governed so strongly around the ABCs of what we can do and what we can't do"
KAM," And ultimately, our our long, long term goal is to save as many patients as we can"
KAM," And we're not saying that, you know, our drug is the best for absolutely everybody, because that's not the case"
KAM, That's not real life
KAM," But what we do is we offer a solution to those patients that need a medication that has the evidence, and it's superior over others, or it can show less bleeding profile, to give you those options, and the variety of medication that is out there, where it kind of fits into your prescribing"
KAM," And, you know, I know that you said the long term plan is slightly different"
KAM," I mean, that the PCM plan, sorry, let me get myself mixed up"
KAM," So you were saying that,"
HCP,Its fine i get mixed up as well
HCP, And I'm
KAM,"sorry, I've got so many notes, I've been jotting down because it was so much I want to try and cover off"
KAM," And obviously in real life, that doesn't happen, because there's so much information that comes up from just having a conversation"
KAM," So I guess with the with your, your PCN management hat on"
KAM," Does that, does that change with the NHS long term plan"
KAM, Or are the goals aligned
HCP,"I'll say the goals are aligned, very much so the focus is very,"
KAM,Yeah what is the main focus
HCP,will it changed changes from year to year
HCP," So basically, the reason for this network contract in PCN's is because I think there's been such a push in the past and the expectation that practices that would work together"
HCP," And certainly, I was aware that to like C Q C was assuming that there'll be a lot of merges"
HCP, So they were expecting primary care registrations to significantly reduce as more and more practices merged
HCP, Yeah
HCP," And that's quite, that's just hasn't happened"
HCP," We've got 1000s of autonomous businesses with very little lever to get them involved apart from you GMS MPMS, called contract to really this PCN is the first time and it's where practices are contractually required to work with each other"
HCP, So that it's been taken quite slowly
HCP," So last year, it was all about extended hours provision"
HCP," This year, there's much more on enhanced health and care homes, and, you know, structured medication reviews getting the difference in I think, the certainly the direction of travel and in, in the board paper that came about integrated care systems from an age thing than last week, or weeks ago, very much about PCN's, and they may well become sort of the commissioners of the future, the terms of not just providing"
HCP, Yeah
HCP," So I think that the PCN's are, are much more of like the voice of what the government wants to do rather than it being what the Federation or practices want to do"
HCP, So I think you need both is complimentary
KAM,"Sure, sure"
KAM," And just coming back to your point around, you know, pharma and and PCN's and kind of working for forward and and by the sounds not engaging with with the pharma industry"
KAM," We have so many resources available and it doesn't mean that you know, you have to take our product because we you know, we've helped, you know, identify some resources that are available for training or so forth"
KAM," We do I mean, it varies where you go the the impact and the relationship that the pharma has with PCN's, luckily, fingers crossed, where I work, we have great relationship with PCN's"
KAM," And ofcourse its not just a what's our agenda and it's not, you know, signing a partnership or how we can support one another"
KAM," So, you know, if those opportunities do arise that an Pfizer can support, especially with identifying some of those out of range patients and what to do with them, if they can't, if they need to be switched to a diet, how do you choose which one is really supporting you with the education and, and the support that we have available"
KAM," Just coming back to something which I read about yourself, I'd want to do soon"
KAM, It's true
KAM," I read something that really did amaze me about this amazing company, which you set up, which you set up, I don't know how you've managed to do that, while holding down various hats"
KAM," In your various roles, called Pet Mix"
KAM, I had a sneaky little peek on the internet to cos i have
KAM," My lovely physiotherapist who we've got such a fantastic relationship with and she's got a couple of dogs, and that she would love some of those beats"
KAM, And her little her little Maisie her dog has currently been having some seizures
KAM," And she's been to the vet, to and fro"
KAM," And I just thought it's probably gonna be the last time I see her this year, next week, maybe I could have a look and see what little parting gift I could give her because she's so so lovely"
KAM, So tell me a little bit about your business
KAM, I was so intrigued when I thought I couldn't believe
HCP,now
HCP," I'm probably thinking, I'm probably shutting it down"
HCP," So let me know, via whoever and I'll get some of the packs to so we got so many of them"
KAM,Ah your shutting it down
HCP,"think it's just it's the concept of it was good, but I think actually getting the pawprint is that still a goer in terms of the packs"
HCP, But I think it's the products because there's so many personalized companies now
HCP," You know, it's probably easier for people who are much more experienced than me just to go to company to do the personalized thing"
HCP," But, but it's certainly the reason it came about was because when I lost one of my dogs very suddenly, and then this is years ago, and then I saw a sort of play paw print"
HCP," And I thought Oh, that's good idea"
HCP, I'll get that and then trying to do it on my then two dogs
HCP, Made me realize it was the messiest thing I've got
KAM,I can Imagine
HCP,"So it's just an early, drop the clip, print and drop that then I'm sorry, um dental in dental amalgam quick drying dental amalgam"
KAM,"Oh, yeah, yeah,"
HCP,I have inside
HCP, I have New foundland dogs
HCP," So there very hairy, and oh god it was just a disaster that my poor dog had pink dental amalgam in her fur, for  four weeks"
HCP, And then I came up 
HCP,with a guinea pig
HCP," So now came across this, these are um in America, so every baby that's born in America automatically has their hand and footprint done"
HCP," And case, in case they get kidnapped"
HCP," And it's it's used also by the FBI for for fingerprints, but it's completely mess free"
HCP," So you just don't like the little wet wipe, and you just wipe on your finger"
HCP," You need special paper, and then just put your finger on it and it comes up"
HCP," And it's just as much detail as you want, depending on how much pressure you put on"
KAM,"Hey, I bought something like that was my first one was born"
KAM, It was a little different from mums and toddlers
KAM,"And all he did was it wasn't like sticky wet clay, you just put your hand in it and it came out clean wet wiped it down"
KAM, And I've got his fingerprints for life
KAM, And he was a little baby because they've doubled in size and tripled in size
KAM," But what a lovely idea, I saw that I saw some of the images that you had on on the website, and I just pulled how very professional the website was"
KAM, It was it was it was difficult initially to find a website because I was reading and then then I clicked into I think it was wolf last
KAM,com
KAM, And then that took me somewhere else
KAM, And then I went finally got into the website
KAM," And that's what a lovely, really well made website and hats off to you"
KAM, What's managing your jobs and the wealth of experience you've got behind you
KAM, And how many years of service I think it was 30 years and a trainer in the sector and still manage to set up your own business
KAM, on the sideline
KAM, I thought I don't know how you do it and made me moaning about my three kids and doing the school run and coming home and cleaning up and doing my jobs
HCP,but i dont have kids that's why
KAM,Has it always been your passion to have your own business or was it something that you kind of thought of with with some quiet time during lockdown and thought what could I do and
HCP,"No, I mean I've worked in my current role"
HCP, I do work freelance anyway
HCP," So I started my first business just up in 1986, doing trading and market research"
HCP, And then a start went freelance again in 1996
HCP, And I've been that ever since 2006
HCP, Yeah 2006
HCP," And, yeah, I really enjoyed"
HCP, So I'm used to that
HCP," doing you know doing a whole different different things I like doing training and education and, you know, keep it"
KAM,Well hats off to you for doing such an amazing job
KAM, And I wouldn't say I wouldn't give up now because now it would be a really good time
KAM," But people are looking for personalized gifts, especially if you can't see relatives and friends and family"
KAM," And yes, I know, there's a lot of people out there doing their personalized bits and bobs"
KAM," But you know what, I think there's a need, there's a niche for yours, because they're different in the sense that you've actually got physically a poor print on the candle, which you can't find anywhere else"
KAM, I haven't seen that anywhere else
KAM, But you've done the hardest job is setting it up
KAM," You know, if you could advertise here and there to get the word, you know, spread out to people to"
HCP,"I think to be honest, I'm sort of umming and arring about this"
HCP," I think when COVID came and never been busier from a health management perspective, years, like Crikey, now trying to organize the immunization sites with the vaccine"
KAM,Isnt that exciting
KAM, I don't know how they're gonna mobilize that
KAM," And, you know, there's so much speculation and everyone's just so grateful that there is a vaccine"
KAM," And the next question is, how did they"
KAM, Do they give it to health care workers first
KAM, Do they give it to the elderly in the care home
KAM, How are they going to distribute it and keep it within that temperature and ensure that the two doses are done within the timeframe
KAM," It's just so many questions, and I'm sure that you know, as a PCN, that, you know, fingers crossed that once they decide how it's going to be how it's going to be mobilized that this makes it sit with yourselves as to add the pcn who and how this is going to be"
HCP,"It's very, it's very fast changing your fluid"
HCP," So as of last Wednesday, so I was in a meeting with the chief executive, the local trust and all the PCN leads"
HCP," And I think the view at that point was the Pfizer vaccine would only go to hospitals, and people go to hospitals for it"
HCP," And yeah, next day, Thursday, urgent meeting required, because PCN's are required to set up sites by"
HCP," Okay, so so yeah, it's a very, it's a very fluid, it changes on a, an hourly basis"
KAM,"yeah, I bet"
KAM, I bet
KAM," I mean, could you imagine if they asked the hospitals to start initiating, I mean, I thought the whole purpose was to keep people away from the hospitals and the NHS staff were inundated with the amount of patients that are coming through, this is just going to increase the workload isnt it"
HCP,"I think they're going to immunize that immunizing the over 80's that are in hospitals, then that starts tomorrow, then it will be NHS I still account, I still don't see how it can be given to care home residents, because it can't be moved from the site at the moment"
HCP," So yeah, then"
HCP, So I think we we've been asked this about doing the over 80s for a PCN perspective
HCP, So I think there's going to be two sites in the first wave across Northumberland
HCP," I mean, we still we've got two sites, we still wait for one site to be confirmed"
KAM,So how exciting What a perfect Christmas gift
KAM, One of the things you would never of asked for it
KAM, The things that you would least expect will be the most gracious gift that we're going to receive
KAM, And that is the fact of going out and just meeting everyone and just doing normal things that we tend to take for granted
KAM," So I'm, I can't wait, I really can't just hope that this this gets rolled out to protect as many cuz we've lost so many lives, and put so many people's lives at risk"
KAM, And it would be nice for us to just have a normal a normal Christmas and a normal life
KAM, That would that would be amazing
KAM," Hilary, thank you so much for your time"
KAM, I know
KAM, It was such a pleasure to hear about your business
KAM, Do not give up
HCP,If you get me your details and you address by whoever then I'll certainly send you some down
KAM,"Oh, you're so sweet"
KAM, You don't have to do that
KAM," But it was just a pleasure to see you open up when you talk about your project your baby, you know, and very few can say that they've had a chance and they've they've gave it a run and they're going to see where it goes"
KAM, So well all done and hats off to you
KAM, And thank you for everything that you do
KAM, If I don't catch you before Christmas Have a fantastic Christmas
KAM, Good luck with the job that you do and take care of yourself
HCP,Take care and lovely to meet you
HCP, Thank you
KAM,Lovely to meet you
KAM, Take care
HCP,Bye
