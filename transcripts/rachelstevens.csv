KAM,Are you happy being called John
HCP,Please do
HCP," Yes,"
KAM,Ah super
KAM," So this is your third one of today, isn't it"
KAM, How's it going
HCP,quite interesting
HCP, I hope it's quite interesting from your end
KAM,"It really, it kind of is because I guess with you, in your role as well, as you're doing a lot more stuff digitally on the phone, more training via this kind of route, how are you finding it all"
HCP,"But I was saying to one of your colleagues, it's gone through phases"
HCP," You know, the first phase was, oh, we can't do that"
HCP, It's terribly technical and difficult
HCP," And then the second phase was actually we quite like doing this and it's saving a lot of petrol and third phases is oh, my goodness, I'm double booked on treble booked, you know, it's a victim of his own success"
HCP, We like it a bit too much
KAM,"I think that's the thing, isn't it"
KAM," I think because initially, to be honest, any reps that you speak to will probably all say exactly the same thing, because we're all so used to seeing people in the flesh"
KAM, Yeah
KAM," And which, you know, between you, me, and the gatepost To be honest, is my preference usually, yeah"
KAM," But I guess at the moment, we've kind of just got to find new and different ways of doing things, haven't we"
KAM," And I, I'm the same, I'll hold my hand up and say, oh I'm not a technophobe"
KAM, But every now and then I get a little bit scared about what might happen
KAM, So you definitely wouldn't be alone on that at all whatsoever
KAM," How have you been finding this morning, though"
KAM, Is it been been quite interesting
HCP,"It has been I mean, you're obviously having to think of new ways of working with the NHS in the same way as the NHS is having to find new ways of working with pharma"
HCP," So yeah, I think, you know, hopefully, we, we came up with some ideas that would work here, not nothing revolution, real world changing"
HCP," But you know, things that work for both sides"
HCP," Yeah,"
KAM,"yeah, absolutely"
KAM," I think that's the thing as well is that we, we quite often think about reinventing the wheel"
KAM," But quite often, we don't have to, we just maybe have to embrace things a little bit more dont we"
HCP,"Yeah, just just be versatile"
HCP," Yeah,"
KAM,absolutely
KAM," So I guess really, the thing for me is just to kind of fill you in on what I do is the same as everybody else that you've spoken to this morning"
KAM, So I work within primary care
KAM," So promoting to GP's, like yourself and practice nurses"
KAM," And I currently work around Surrey and Sussex, but I may actually be working in Kent next year"
KAM, Because we've just had a little bit of a restructure
KAM," So you may see me in the flesh at some point in the future, but we'll see how that goes"
KAM," And in which case, it'd be lovely to see in the flesh"
KAM," And but yeah, so I and I've been doing that for quite a while"
KAM," And so it's just kind of really nice to just, I think it's been quite difficult for us this year, as well, because we're not speaking to as many people"
KAM," Sure, it's really nice to speak to real live people and you know, have a conversation with people that we might not know so well, and do something a little bit differently, really"
KAM, And so that's kind of a I've been working from home with a four year old for most of this year
KAM, So that's been interesting
KAM," So that's been the challenge, really, so"
KAM, But he's now just started school
KAM," So that's, that's quite nice, gives me a little bit of a break"
KAM,"So I really kind of, I suppose our brief you've probably been, it's been explained to our brief isn't to really sell you the drugs promote the drugs, it's really just to kind of have a chat, see how this technology works and that kind of thing"
KAM," So, but I guess just to I've done a little bit of research"
KAM, So I probably have a little bit of an advantage there because there's probably a lot more about you on the internet than there is about me
KAM, And it's all good
KAM," And but I it made for some really, really interesting reading"
KAM," So I guess I just want to find out a little bit more about, I suppose, the things that you love about what you do"
KAM, And I know that you've been involved in a lot of things around integrated care partnerships
KAM, I really just want to find out a little bit more about you if that's okay
KAM, And my apologies if this is the third time you've done this today
HCP,"It's slightly different slant, Rachel"
HCP," So that's, that's fine"
HCP," And do do stop me if I go off in the wrong direction or whatever, but not not at all"
HCP," Yeah, I mean, I mean, I am a GP"
HCP, I'm also a PCN clinical director
HCP," And I'm also director of strategy for our single practice, PCN"
HCP," I mean, that probably most PCNs primary care networks are across more than one practice"
HCP," But we sort of saw this coming and also because of my history of being involved in encompass MCP, you know, March professional clinical provider, and it wasn't a huge jump to go become a PCN because after all, Simon Stephens model the concept of PCN's on the evidence on the new care models including mcps including encompass so we just sort of moved sideways and rebadged it"
HCP," But so, but whereas encompass had five clinical hubs"
HCP," Now, I'm clinical director of one clinical hub which has now been repackaged as a pcn"
HCP, The practice over probably a couple of decades actually has got more and more involved in developing and community integrated healthcare as we call it
HCP," In other words, hopefully high quality general practice alongside a load of stuff you'd have to go to hospital for"
HCP," So in our practice, in one of our buildings history view, we provide a range of outpatients diagnostics and urgent treatment center, a fully compliant ultra clean operating theater where cataract surgery and dermatological surgery has done a bit of orthopedics as well"
HCP," So, you know, it always struck me as nuts when I left medical school, you know, we were one tribe in medical school, then we turn into two tribes, you know, that the general practice tribe and the hospital tribe and I never really see the sense in that I don't see why we can't do things together"
HCP, And so we have over 20 consultants working out at one of our buildings history view
HCP, And we have a number of GPS who are now called chippers that used to be called gypsies
HCP," GP's with a special interest in an NHS can't leave, acronyms alone have to change them"
HCP," So gypsies are now gypers, which means GP with extended role"
HCP," So we have,"
KAM,because I haven't actually heard that term yet
KAM, That's the first time I've heard it
HCP,It's been around for a year or so
HCP," But yeah, a lot of people start with Gypsy still, because gyper sounds a bit strange"
HCP," Anyway, that's it"
HCP," But so we do general practice, we do elective care"
HCP, But we also do urgent care from our urgent treatment centers
HCP," So we are the only urgent treatment center, any skin that has virtual fracture clinics face to face fracture clinics"
HCP, So you complete the whole fracture journey without having to go to a hospital
HCP, And also we run a full DVT diagnosis and treatment services
HCP," And that's 12 hours a day, 365 days a year"
HCP," And ultrasound is open six days of the week, which is one more day than the hospitals open"
HCP," And we you know, we try and strive for a good patient experience as much as possible to finish their journey in in our community, rather than have to go to hospital unnecessarily"
HCP," So, you know, as a range of our patients, day procedures, day surgery, and the urgent care side of things, and we have x ray open 12 hours a day, 365 days a year"
HCP," We have a visiting MRI scanner one day a week actually is there permanently at the moment, because the hospitals have got so much COVID there, they've dropped it in our carpark and has been gone"
HCP, So that hopefully gives you some flavor of the integration that we like to do
HCP," And we also employ relevant to your role, we employed two pharmacists, and one pharmacy technician in our practice under the under the scheme that allows pcms to employ people who are called AR s people, you know, Allied something something specialist"
HCP," So yeah, so we've got social prescribers, pharmacists, we just out to advert for a tour operators and a dietitian as well"
HCP, So these are the additional additional roles that we're allowed to employ
KAM,Yeah
KAM, Wow
KAM," So it almost sounds like a sort of little primary care mini hospital really, isn't it"
KAM,"Because there are just so many things that you've embraced, and it's really quite forward thinking"
HCP,"Well, we weren't"
HCP," Yes, yeah, we were an NHS exemplar"
HCP, In the days that exemplars existed
HCP," And then yeah, the core of a new care model called encompass MCP"
HCP, So we've always tried to innovate
HCP," But you know that the principle is the same in everything we do, which is to try and improve the patient experience"
HCP, And that's what we've done
HCP," And we get quite a lot of visitors in, including Simon Stephens himself and Jeremy Hunt, just to come to look at it"
HCP," Now, you know, what, what is this strange thing"
HCP, You've done it
HCP," So yeah, that's it"
KAM,Now it sounds really good
KAM," I mean, I, I've kind of spent many years working Surrey, Sussex and South London"
KAM," And it's amazing how many I've been doing this job for quite a while, but it's amazing how many surgeries I've just lost you on my screen there weren't you back"
KAM," And it's amazing how many surgeries are still you know, you still got single GP practices, surgeries that do absolutely no extracurricular things at all whatsoever, so to hear what you do, and that's why I think it's so forward thinking because I think they so many areas and places that really really need to catch up"
KAM," Have you found that it's kind of worked better for you, kind of this year with everything else that's going on"
KAM, And people not baby being able to go to hospital and stuff
KAM," Do you think it's really worked, you know, had an advantage"
HCP,"I guess we've all had our challenges, there's no doubt no doubt about that"
HCP," And I mean, one of the first things we did was build a four lane drive thru in the carpark of one of our three surgeries"
HCP," So we we use that initially for COVID patients, that was our hot side or red side, whichever term you prefer to try and protect the buildings and the staff in the buildings from transmission"
HCP," And then that as the first wave settled down a bit, we then started to use it for winter flu vaccination"
HCP, And we found the patients absolutely loved it
HCP, We could do one a minute in each of the four lanes
HCP, So we were doing for a minute here
HCP," You know, 800 was quite easy to do, just driving through, and we had some lovely volunteers who did the traffic management side of things"
HCP," And now we're coming towards the end of our winter flu immunization program, done 80% of over 65"
HCP," Now, people have come in much more than they have in previous years, then yeah, woken up to that it's a good idea"
HCP, And now we're just gearing up to use it as our COVID designated immunization site
HCP, So we've kept it on our own expense
HCP," But people seem to be happier to do that sort of thing in their cars, rather than walking through a building where they're a bit nervous"
HCP," Oh, my goodness, am I gonna catch something"
HCP," So yeah,"
KAM,I think that's the thing is we've had to find so many different ways of doing things in all aspects
KAM," And in all areas haven't we, it it does sound like um, because I haven't heard of anybody doing obviously, I know that people hospitals do the drive throughs to the COVID"
KAM," So for example, my dad had a hip replacement back in October"
KAM, So he just went into a drive in COVID testing before his operation and all that kind of stuff
KAM, So I know that the hospitals doing a lot of that
KAM, But to hear GP surgeries doing that is really quite phenomenal
KAM, I think
HCP,"we've got a good relationship with the community and spoke to one of the local developers and said look, we really think we need this and this is a sketch and blow me down, it was up and operational before the CCG had actually done produced the service specification"
HCP, So they built a thing in a broad traffic management in completely changed all of that in the space of three weeks
HCP," And we were up and running as I say a first off, which was, and it's really been fantastic in that respect, you know, the the public respond to what we're trying to do"
HCP," And they're very supportive, and it's very helpful"
KAM,"Yeah, do you find because it just sounds just so I mean, I've got, I'm going off on a bit of a tangent here"
KAM, And it might be the first time probably won't be the last
KAM, But I've got parents who live just around the corner for me both with extensive health issues
KAM," And I mean, admittedly, my our local surgery doesn't do as much as yours does"
KAM," They do do a lot, and they are absolutely fantastic"
KAM, Good
KAM, But because of the things that they do
KAM, It would I would love to see them
KAM, I guess blossom is blossom the right word
KAM, I don't know
KAM, But I would love to see them blossom in the way that your your center obviously has
KAM," Um, do you find that you"
KAM," I mean, I guess you get to speak to people at conferences and all that kind of thing"
KAM," Do you see what your center does as being quite, I suppose unique"
KAM, Or are you finding more and more areas of doing that now
HCP,I think a lot of people love the concept
HCP," As you say, I get dragged here, there and everywhere to talk about it"
HCP, And we get a lot of visitors as well
HCP," And people people love it until you say that, too"
HCP, They say how did how was it funded
HCP, Who Who
HCP, Who bought it
HCP, We said actually we did that and then the shoulders go down
KAM,Always stopped at the money
KAM," Yeah,"
HCP,"well, I mean, if in a built up area, finding the space is difficult, and yeah, it's a big site"
HCP, But the the problem with general practice funding is you can get something called notional rent or CMR
HCP, The current market rent for g o for GMS buildings
HCP," But if you build something for hospital type work, you're on your own"
HCP, And the principle is simple
HCP, You build it you get a thundering great mortgage and then you try to attract community contracts to pay for the building the staff and you know they need like a bit of surplus
HCP," But that's the point where it gets risky because us as GPS and you know, I'm talking about mon brutes I'm allowed to you know, we're very constitute self employed people, you know, you've got a guaranteed source of income and you know exactly what you're going to get money what you want, but you know what you're going to get the concept of actually spending quite a few million pounds on a new building at risk, because if a CCG won't give you enough contracts for Community Services, then You've got a big mortgage and empty rooms"
HCP, And that that was the gamble
HCP, That was the risk
HCP," And that's the thing that frightens people, they love the concept of working like this"
HCP, And the additional accidental benefit that you don't ever end up with staff vacancies
HCP," I mean, we we have a waiting list for GPS, nurses, secretaries, receptionists, which I never really expected to happen, because they like the what this way of working"
HCP," Yeah, what to come and work with us"
HCP," And that's great, because there's an awful lot of unfilled clinical posts in the community"
HCP," Yeah, you know, lots lots of GPS missing, and nurses, and we don't have that problem"
HCP," So it's, it's a really good model for that, in that respect"
HCP, You don't got to worry about when someone retires
HCP," Yeah, but you've just got to take on the financial risk"
HCP, That's the problem
KAM,"That's the thing, isn't it"
KAM," But like you said, it's quite unusual though to have people kind of queuing up wanting to work with you because I know that in a lot of areas, recruitment is really difficult"
KAM, I know a lot of areas have had real trouble recruiting practice pharmacists and clinical pharmacists actually haven't I think
HCP,Yeah I mean east kent is no exception
HCP," In fact, we know we have a large number of GP and other allied health, personal places, vacancies unfilled"
HCP," But you know, it's slightly embarrassing that people will always want to come work with us"
HCP," So it's, it's very nice side effect"
KAM,"Yeah, no, that's really good"
KAM, And if you've got any kind of special areas of interest yourself that you're able to fulfill because you've got this extended center
HCP,"Yeah, I mean, I'm I have been for quite a long time a GP surgeon"
HCP, I've now become less than full time and I do local steroid injection clinics
HCP,So I i complement our physiotherapists
HCP," You know, we we work together on musculoskeletal problems"
HCP," And that's nice for me, but others of my colleagues, our GP, dermatologists, dp diabetologist"
HCP, And GP surgeons
HCP, One we had one GP was an herbal epilepsy specialist
HCP," And in the UTC our lead nurse, or ACP, she's call you know, acute care practitioner"
HCP," She's done a master's degree in thromboembolism, and she runs the DVT service with help from a visiting consulting mythologist"
HCP," And, to be honest, she knows more than the GPS"
HCP," So it's very good, you know,"
KAM,sounds brilliant sounds outside
KAM," Well, all I can say"
KAM," I'm just looking at the time so I'm conscious of your time as well, knowing that you've got another call at half past one"
KAM, And I'd love to have a break in between
KAM," and but it's been really interesting hearing about it, I'd love to see that happen across a lot more areas, because I think it is really innovative what you've done"
KAM," And, and it'd be really nice to kind of see that happen on a much wider scale"
KAM, So I could probably chat for ages
KAM, But I will let you go and it's been really lovely to meet you and all but all be digitally but very nice to meet you
KAM, And hopefully you get to have a nice rest after your next call
KAM, I've been really chatting to you
HCP,"Okay, well nice to speak to you, Rachel and if you do come to Kent, may see you in person as well"
KAM,"Yeah, he may indeed Look forward to it"
KAM," Thank you, john"
KAM, Okay
KAM, Thank you
KAM, Bye
