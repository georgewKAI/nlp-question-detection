KAM,Good morning
KAM, So you're in for a day of excitement with Pfizer then today
HCP,"Yes, absolutely"
KAM,You got these plans for the whole throughout the whole day
HCP,"No, no, I've got an hour session now than an hour session at 1pm"
KAM,"Oh, that's not too bad"
KAM, At least you can have a little grip
KAM," By the end, you may need a slight drink by the end of it"
KAM," I have to say, but it's really good of you to join us today and take part in this"
KAM, I think it's is new for us as it is for you
KAM, So and I think it'll be interesting to see what they come back with
KAM, So we're not allowed to show any content
KAM, And my understanding is your pharmacist within secondary care
KAM, Correct
KAM, Excellent
KAM," Okay, so we can talk about anything realistically, but we should probably veer towards something to do with work"
KAM," So I'm sort of wondering how you're getting on with your ICS planning, and how that's looking for you and what sort of shape that's taking because I cover surrey and Sussex, and east Berkshire area"
KAM, And there are the various varying stages across the whole area
KAM," So it's quite interesting just to get a feel, because I think everybody's doing it slightly differently"
KAM," So in interesting way, just so that we can at least have some experience, because it's all quite new"
HCP,So we have kind of unofficially been trying to move towards an ICS model for some time
HCP, And we've actually even given it a name
HCP," So its Derbyshire together, which means our community, supposedly our community services, our secondary care, our CCG, or completely aligned and working towards the same objectives"
HCP," Until the pot of money isn't one, you never truly going to be an ICS"
HCP," But things have been speeding up over the last couple of months, I'd say"
HCP," Even though we've got COVID going on, there's been quite a few official appointments for an ICS based model in the whole healthcare economy"
KAM,"Okay, well, that's, that's quite interesting, because I am finding, across other areas that despite everything that's happening at the moment with them, with the craziness of it, in the NHS, things are starting to move along"
KAM," And I think maybe it's because some of the higher level guys are freed up slightly, and it's more the clinicians that are at the coalface, as such, so it's given them a little bit of time to concentrate on some of the things that are becoming quite important"
KAM," But and interesting, as you say, until there is one pot of money, it's never going to be a completely unified service"
KAM," But and so just in terms, then is how do you think that's going to make your job change within within that sort of structure,"
HCP,"I think it's gonna take, potentially take some autonomy and decision making away from us, and kind of amalgamate that power into a few individuals, which is concerning, but then I can see the efficiency side of it as well"
HCP," So I'm talking more about formulary decisions, access to medicines, that kind of that kind of aspect of of life is gonna change for us"
KAM,And I think you're not the only one that's going to feel that and that almost that lack of autonomy so that you can't actually make those decisions
KAM, And do you feel that that could probably bring about better communication so that everybody really is on the same page
KAM," Or do you think it's going to end up being told you this is what you're going to do, because it's going to happen across the whole trust, and this whole ICS"
KAM," And you've got to do anyway, whether you whether you agree with it, or you don't agree with it"
HCP,"The second one, it's not going to be a case of communication, it's going to be a case of just seeing this made and your job is to just carry out"
KAM,"Do you see that causing a problem because in my head, that's starting to raise a few little flags"
HCP,"Again, it all depends on the leadership that you're working with, you know, you can say the same thing, or you can say it in two different ways"
HCP," And you get a completely different result in terms of the, the attitude of the person receiving the information"
HCP," So I don't think I'd be like judgmental now and be really cynical, although in my nature is cynical, to say you know, it's going to be all disaster"
HCP, But it's difficult to motivate people to work on specific projects or make specific changes when they're not owning that decision
KAM,"No, I fully appreciate that"
KAM," So I have to be honest, that aside, I hadn't really thought of too much"
KAM," And I suppose in my mind, I had a very optimistic view that literally everybody would be involved in the decisions that come through and hopefully that they'd have a almost an overarching communication channel"
KAM, Wherever everybody could feeding tube
KAM," I suppose that's quite unrealistic,"
HCP,"but it's going to be those those few superior elite individuals who are handpicked are going to be part of that conversation, not those little soldiers"
HCP, Yes
KAM,So do you think they'll come from within your organization
KAM, or do you think there going to be external
HCP,Gonna be people from our organization
HCP," So I know, unofficially, people have already started being appointed to positions, you'll have the same it's gonna be the same people within secondary care, primary care, tertiary care, this is the same leaders who are going to be enacting this change"
HCP, So yeah
KAM,"Okay, that makes me think it's not, yes, there'll be changes, but it would just be somebody else working from a slightly different remit"
KAM," Yeah, they"
HCP,just get new name badge
HCP, So
KAM,"Oh, okay"
KAM, Interesting
KAM," So do you think that's gonna have a big impact on your formulary decisions, then"
HCP,"I think it's gonna take away some of that autonomous, some of that the hospitals traditionally have always had the power to do what they kind of thought was best for them"
HCP, And I'd say the motivation behind that was either clinical evidence or money
HCP, And we are PVR
HCP," So we are paying for alot of our own drugs, and we make certain decisions"
HCP," Over the last five years, I'd say that that kind of culture has changed to actually, we're still making the decisions, we're going to talk to you about it"
HCP," And if you have any massive concerns, and fair enough, we'll have a conversation about it, I think that's gonna completely change, it's going to be a case of a decision is made centrally in this new joint formulary decision making body, you've got access to everyone, but not everyone"
HCP," And then that decision making process becomes a bit polarized, because it's just a few individuals"
HCP, And the genuine concerns of a specific organization are no longer going to be taken into account
HCP," Now, I'm not saying that's going to be a negative thing"
HCP," I think I think we have to be fair and give it a chance to work, but I can see the negative side of it, as well as the positive side of it"
KAM,Do you think then they'll be led more by cost than they will buy by evidence
KAM," Do you think cost is going to be a bigger play a bigger part in it plays a big part,"
HCP,"I don't have to say anything concrete, what I will say in secondary care, we are less driven by customer more driven by evidence"
HCP," And in CCG, or PCG Call it whatever you like, they have always always been about acquisition cost, always, they don't have an appreciation for that patient"
HCP, Because they don't see the patient
KAM,No and that that's it
KAM, So that's gonna make it will make my job
KAM," Quite different, I think because we we are, when we talk to clinicians, we talk clinically, we don't talk about costings at all"
KAM, So I do think that that's going to make it very different conversation that we have to start having with them
KAM," And I think that's probably something that our industry needs to address, as well, because they get really separated roles out that somebody else will deal with cost, so that it doesn't blur any of the clinical efficacy side of things"
KAM, And so I think that's quite an interesting take on how it's going to be
KAM," And it'll be interesting to see how we deal with it as an industry, because I do we move faster"
KAM, I'm not necessarily sure we do move any faster to change how and how we work in that
KAM, But we are looking to realign ourselves more with the NHS
KAM, So I think this is going to be sort of quite interesting times
KAM," And it'll be interesting with, I think, from our side of things that some of the autonomy will be taken away from the CCG as such, and it should theoretically make it slightly more equal"
KAM," I don't know whether I'm, you know, unrealistic in that"
HCP,And it should I create should put because it's a few individuals who now retain the power
HCP, I'm not convinced it's going to be as efficient as we want it to be
HCP," So if you've got a chief pharmacist from a hospital, and then medicines, management at the CCG, sorry, they're not the best people to make the decisions"
KAM,"No, So are they going to involve many clinical people onto the ICS or deciding committee for want of a better word"
HCP,They're just going to make posts on their leadership posts
HCP, So it's going to be a clinical director is going to be an existing clinical director somewhere
HCP," But in terms of a formulary application within the trust at the moment, you know, we'll have a clinical lead for that therapy area, and we'll have the specialist pharmacist and we've got a formulary pharmacist, we've got a CCG representative"
HCP, So we've got a really localized approach to it
HCP," You know, and yes, there is variation in care throughout the UK throughout different hospitals"
HCP, But it's not the beauty of it
HCP," The Commission wants to try something that he felt He believes in, they should have the right to do that"
KAM,"Do you think then that you're going to lose individuality, as it from a trust then"
KAM," Do you think it's going to become a national, almost a national one size fits all"
HCP,"But not nationally, I'd say across the ICS Yeah, absolutely"
HCP," It with an ICS we're gonna have Stoke hospital, we're gonna have Darby, just kind of from the same terms of formulary"
KAM,"Okay, okay, well, I suppose demographically, the there will be changes across the UK, so it can't all match up"
KAM," But, you know, from what you what you how you've described it, to me there It does sound to me as though ultimately, somewhere buried in the ether of it all is we want a one size fits all across the whole of the NHS, and I'm just, I can't I can't see how they're going to make that work"
KAM," But I think maybe somewhere in the subtext, somebody's written that and say, I may be, I may be slightly more cynical than you are in that respect"
HCP,"The term postcode lottery has been thrown around a lot in conversations, and I think that's, that's a secondary, tertiary endpoint that they're trying to achieve"
KAM,Yes
KAM, And we even have that here
KAM, So I'm at the other end of the country to you
KAM, So I'm in the south
KAM, And
HCP,Thats where all the money is
KAM,"we'd like to say that, but I'm not sure that those here would agree with you"
KAM," And, and I do appreciate we, we have different pressures, and we have a much older demographic, potentially than you guys do"
KAM," And, you know, so our, our services are aimed at that end of it"
KAM," And I'm not, you know, I can't get into this more money here or there"
KAM," Hey, who knows at the moment"
KAM," So just in terms of that, then just swinging it around slightly differently now"
KAM," And just because I'm slightly, I'd say curious, but I think the real words nosey so and you guys then have been really quite badly impacted by the COVID situation at the moment"
KAM," So is that really having a really big sort of massive knock on effect across your whole area, then"
HCP,Absolutely
HCP, Absolutely
HCP, I think the second wave has been worse than the first wave
HCP, And there's a couple of reasons for that
HCP," Number one, staff morale motivation is down"
HCP," Yeah, so workforce has been a massive issue, we've had massive spikes in the number of members of staff, either falling severely ill, or passing away or just not being able to come into work"
HCP," Childcare issues have played a huge, huge, huge part of it as well"
HCP," And there's been times when we've had no it ITU specialist from school, and you've had to pull over pull over the people and train them up as best as we could"
HCP, For a short period of time
HCP," We've changed the way we work a lot of instances, just to protect ourselves and protect our patients"
HCP," And then on the other side of it, we've proven that in the first wave, we no longer were an NHS service, we were a COVID service"
HCP, Yeah
HCP," So all elective activity, outpatient activity was stopped to a bare minimum"
HCP," This time, we've attempted to kind of maintain some level of of elective for outpatient activity"
HCP," And that's been a real challenge, you know, for workforce for the patients"
HCP," For our conditions, we've got this massive backlog, which is playing on our mind in the middle of winter pressures, although you could argue it's not as bad as it normally is"
HCP," Yeah, it's not been great at all"
HCP," And then you're hearing things on in the national press, or it's got nothing to do"
HCP," Well, tell you, tell you now its not true"
KAM,Are you in tier 3 where you are
HCP,"correct, yes"
KAM,Okay
KAM," So we are we now teir two, for pretty much most of the area that I cover, and discussions I've been having are almost the first wave, kind of like, hit everybody"
KAM," And we're just like, Whoa, you dealt with it, I sort of on the on the run"
KAM, And people have said they feel slightly better prepared the second time round
KAM," But again, I think the pressures that we have at this end of the world are slightly different from the pressures you have, because you are a higher tier than we are and and therefore you've got more cases"
KAM," I think we've had lots of issues with our care homes in this area, because there's because of the demographics of the population, but it's an interesting one, to see what what stories we get come through after this way"
KAM," And to certain extent, we are leaving a charmed existence compared to some of you guys"
KAM," But that said, I think we're more so slightly shielded from it"
KAM, We don't really understand the whole the whole situation of it
HCP,I think I think the tier the whole tier system is a fallacy to be fair the tier system doesn't represent the true reality of working on the ground
HCP, How can I reach in the size of a whole county be represented by a single number In a tier it just doesn't work
HCP, no
HCP," Think we're going to lose focus on his bed capacity it capacity, number of deaths"
HCP," And that's the more kind of, again, in my opinion does that's what we're going to fix I'm not a tier given by somebody sitting in Whitehall"
HCP," But I think throughout the country, every hospital will be feeling the same, because you know, they've got reduced capacity that you're having to work very, very differently"
HCP," Because see the same note, just go into an outpatient or elective surgery clinic and you see the anguish of patients"
HCP," My parents have been, I've been on a waiting list for over a year now"
HCP," Oh, quite minor things"
HCP, And it's had a massive impact on their lives alongside the fact that they're in lockdown
HCP, So it's worrying from their perspective
KAM,And I do think this is going to have much more far reaching long lasting legacy than any of us ever actually realized at the beginning
KAM," And but not only through the health service, but through all sorts of aspects of society, you know, I think our education system, and it's going to implode"
KAM," And so we can only hope that there are lights at the end of the tunnel with this, whether there is or not jury's out at the moment, let's wait and see in another few months"
KAM," But you know, it's one of those things, isn't it"
KAM, You kind of you have no control over this
KAM, We just have to deal with it as best as we can
HCP,"And so that's all we can hope to achieve, isn't it"
HCP, It's just trying to keep your head open
HCP," And if you're, if you're leading a team is trying to make sure everyone's okay"
HCP," Yeah, and really kind of more than ever being a leader in this is so, so important"
HCP," So, all you can one conversation in the morning with your team can change the whole day"
HCP," Yeah, just noticing subtle changes in the behavior of people, their own stresses in their personal lives could be impacting them, I think we just really treat each other as humans, whether it's at work or at home or on the street, and have a bit more compassion"
HCP, And I think that's the way forward
KAM,"And I think that's something we all need to take on board not just only within your service, but it's something I could probably do more of, and suddenly all of us could do more or"
HCP,Absolutely Absoltely
KAM,"Okay, so I'm now very mindful of time, I could stay here and talk to you for quite a long time on this because I think it's really interesting, especially to see the regional differences, but I'm fully aware that you may need to have a battery recharge in between"
KAM, So and what I can only say to you is thank you so much for today
KAM, It actually has been really enlightening and it does give me things to think about so and I will leave you to carry on and and i hope conversations at least have a slight change to them as you go through the day
HCP,Perfect
HCP, That's great
KAM,"Okay, thank you so much for your time, and I'll sign off now"
KAM, Just have a good Christmas New Year and keep yourself safe
HCP,Thank you You too
HCP, Cheerio
HCP, Bye
