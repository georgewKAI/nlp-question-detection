KAM,"Hi there, Dr"
KAM, Ribchester So let me just click on this
KAM," Okay, so I'm Jessica and work for Pfizer, sadly not on the vaccine side of things, but on the anticoagulation side, and I actually work in Oxfordshire"
KAM," Yeah, so I don't know if you know anyone up there, but and what we're about what we're often about here, up here in Pfizer, and Oxfordshire is the sort of value that in healthcare systems that apixaban can bring"
KAM, And it's the use of apixaban in particularly for your MVAF patients and helping prevent strokes
KAM," I think it's my key role working for Pfizer, and that's what I like to think of my job as opposed to championing what what my drug might do or doesn't do, but looking at those aspects, which will will bring you value value to your whole system as opposed to the pcn and looking how to integrate what your needs are and how they can be delivered with the apixaban"
KAM," When, during this time, I think it's been a difficult time, and I think it might have shown exactly how pcn probably can come work together and develop what's actually required in terms of a knock on effects that products bring and the services that they need to improve things like capacity and things what sort of challenges that you're finding"
HCP,"Okay, well, first of all, please call me John"
HCP," I've been speaking with you, but one of your colleagues Tarik earlier, so I may find myself repeating myself a little bit because his main interest is apixaban as well"
HCP," And I was, I was explaining to him but we are a single practice pcn"
HCP," I am a PCN clinical director, the one for Whitstable"
HCP," I'm also GP director of strategy for the practice, but very much for us the pcn of the practice is one on the same, you know, we have 25 GPS, three medical centers, and we major and have done for a couple of decades now, on integrated health care such that less slightly less than half of our turnover is gms"
HCP," In other words, standard general practice"
HCP," The other half involves providing community integrated health care, the sort of stuff you'd probably have to go to hospital for normally"
HCP," So in terms of apixaban, and we provide a seven day a week, 12 hour a day DVT diagnosis and treatment service, and we use apixaban for that"
HCP, So we're already sort of aligned on that one
HCP," With regard to AF and anticoagulation for AF we are transitioning people from using warfarin to apixaban or NOAX or DOACs generally, but apixaban seems to be the one because we started off using it in our urgent treatment center that we provide"
HCP, And therefore we've already got experience of it
HCP, So that that's okay
HCP, It's a bit of a bit of a shot in the foot
HCP," For general practice, of course, moving people off warfarin, because the whole idea of providing INR clinics, which we do, and as do those general practices, is actually paid paid activity"
HCP," And if you've got it right, you will make a small profit on that"
HCP," And of course, the more people you move to a diet, the less profit you're gonna make"
HCP," But I think the focus has become as did you use your word on capacity now, particularly in this time of COVID"
HCP," Because the concept of getting people into the buildings to do their INR's has become more challenging, because we've had divert our nursing staff on to what we call the red route"
HCP," You know, we like other general practices, we've got the cold routes for people who probably haven't got COVID and the red roof, people probably have got COVID"
HCP, And we've only got a finite number of staff
HCP," So if we move our nurses into the Red Room, they're going to have to leave something behind"
HCP, And one obvious thing to leave behind are the INR clinics
HCP, So switching people onto apixaban has become well something of a necessity in order to release nurse hours
HCP, For the for the hot side red route activity
HCP, You can use whichever term you like
HCP, And even though it's it's it's It's a money loser
HCP, It's something we have to do in order to sustain our staffing levels
KAM,Yes
KAM," I mean, I could see when it comes to actually getting pots of money"
KAM, It must be a bit of a
KAM, Yes
KAM, Yeah
KAM, Ironic
KAM, I think it is ironic
KAM," It is ironic, I think, with my limited knowledge of PCN's and looking at how you can show prevention, ambulatory care, or personalized care, there are other pots of money where your demonstration of sharing that personalized care might trigger payments from other pots because I do know that PCN's can can gain gain from other areas with once, once those, once we've got COVID out of the way that that that showing that would that does that not sort of really further"
HCP,It's not it's not a major income stream to us
HCP," As I was saying earlier, more than half of our income stream is from 3g integrated healthcare"
HCP," We, we we provide a range of outpatient diagnostics, we run an urgent treatment center, we have an ultra clean operating theatre where cataract surgery is done"
HCP," So this is not not a big deal for us, although for other practices, you have a much smaller percentage of non GMS income it may seem more relevant"
HCP," So I mean, the world changes, you know, some doors shut other doors open"
HCP, One has to be philosophical
KAM,"Yes, yes"
KAM,"I mean, I think the overall, although I think I think with with Stroke Prevention that brings with it better, you know, you're not you're not doing secondary care and referrals"
KAM, And you're you're not having that impact in the cost that way
KAM, That sort of that that money saving idea of of your patients are cared for
KAM," Because they're not getting their stroke, and then you're not having all those knock on effects that a stroke brings"
KAM," But you're like you say that doesn't come in directly, you don't see Do you won't be able to value that that at all"
KAM," I mean, that's that's difficult to put a price on a stroke prevention"
HCP,absolutely is
HCP," But I mean, obviously we we don't just go around money we care about the patients"
HCP, And the concept of reducing morbidity and mortality is very dear to our heart
HCP," And so, yeah, that's absolutely important"
KAM,"So we've within Oxfordshire with they've looked at the apixaban news and over the last two years and looked at how many strokes they've prevented, as opposed to using warfarin"
KAM," So it was it was a trial, a certain clinical paper done by one of the clinical pharmacists in the hospitals"
KAM," And it showed instead of switch switching those patients from warfarin to apixaban, saved oxfrodshire CCG's 17 strokes"
KAM," So yes, that that would be diluted out throughout the CCG as to which practice gains that but it's that, like you say it's that patient side of thing that you've got to keep bringing back to the forefront"
KAM," Of course, that's the whole reason why you're you're doing your"
HCP,Why I came tomedicine in the first place
HCP," So yes,"
KAM,yes
KAM, And it's that value that needs to be to be looked at
KAM," But the but the, from my understanding, I mean, the challenges keep changing, and the immediate short term challenge"
KAM," You know, what would a NOAC, thePerfect NOAC look like to you I mean, you do have a choice"
KAM," And you say apixaban, you tend to tend to use it more often in your in your DBT clinics"
KAM, And that but but are there times when you feel apixaban isn't appropriate or
HCP,"No, it's not really that so we started off with the rivaroxaban because it was the first one around, we switched to apixaban, probably because of liaison with east kent hospitals trust because it became their, their front runner"
HCP," And when they switched, we followed simply because we liaise with them about, well patient care in general"
HCP," But certainly with regard to our DVT pathway, we do the A's is one of the hematologists although we use for advice for the complex cases, only but you know we're very, very well aware of what each other are doing"
HCP, So I suppose it was a bit of an East Kent wide switch from rivaroxaban to apixaban
HCP," And so there may be some people who are left on rivaroxaban and simply because if people are used to something they don't wish to switch you know, it isn't broken, I don't want to fix it"
HCP," Leave me alone, please"
HCP," So there but the minority and all of the new cases certainly tend to be on apixaban, if they're not going to opt for warfarin, because some people actually like the psychological crutch of having warfarin monitoring"
HCP," Which, of course, unnecessary with NOAC's"
KAM,Yes
KAM," And with and with that, is that sort of a counseling thing where you can present it to them the option of NOAC's"
KAM," What what what do patients say that they got dislike about a sort of, you know, twice a day"
KAM, I think you're monitoring it
HCP,"Yeah, it's the switch from a drug warfarin, which requires monitoring, and we use drumming into them, you may get the dose wrong, you might bleed or you might have another stroke"
HCP," And then all of a sudden, here's another drug, which is much more convenient"
HCP, But there's no monitoring
HCP," And that frightens some people, I think, Oh, no, I've needed monitoring, you've drummed into me, I've been on warfarin for Lord knows how long with monitoring and besides which I like seeing the nurse because she's friendly"
HCP," blow me down, you're saying that's right, my life is gone"
HCP, So some people have a real real issue with that
HCP," Having said that, new people are very keen not to have to come in for blood tests and monitoring"
HCP, So it's easier starting someone on a NOAC than it is switching someone from Warframe
KAM,"Yeah, and you've got to be respectful of that"
KAM," And this the persuasion of you know, this, there's less major bleeding and with the NOAC and"
HCP,"yeah, I mean, we obviously say all of that"
HCP, Yeah
KAM,"You know, they get to routine, isn't it"
HCP,"Yeah, sorry, is that the typical comment back is, but how do you know, the dose is right"
HCP,"you know, you know, with with warfarin, you knew, because I had INR and how do you know, now, you know, so"
HCP,"But having said that, you know, in this in this time of COVID, people are less willing to come into a medical establishment because they're scared of what they might catch"
HCP, And so the switchovers have been have become more more common this year
KAM,"So, so looking at your the challenges with finding your new patients, how has that been in this particular time"
KAM," Because they're not presenting, I suspect"
HCP,Well I think all current disease management has taken a bit of a hit
HCP," Really, because as I was saying earlier, we've had to switch a lot of our team on to the red roots"
HCP," And now we're involved in COVID, virtual wards, and we're just about to switch from winter flu immunizations to COVID vaccinations"
HCP," So there's a lot of stuff going on a lot of staff hours going on, involved in non standard pursuits"
HCP, So it is a bit of an issue
HCP," I mean, we are dealing with more people remotely as GP's and our team than we ever were in the past"
HCP," You know, all consultations start with a video call or an audio call"
HCP, So the opportunity to just literally grab someone's wrist and opportunistically discover AF is much less than it was which which is a shame
HCP, So I haven't seen our fingers for this year
HCP, But I wouldn't mind betting that arm our rate of putting new patients on the AF register has probably gone down this year
HCP," Not just for us, but in England as a whole"
KAM,"And would would, because because that could be anticipated"
KAM," Would there be a program say to look at patients with hypertension or obesity or diabetes to do maybe get other teams involved, like pharmacists, to to check the pulse of those patients"
KAM," Well,"
HCP,"I mean, we we do opportunistically do this for everyone you meet face to face anyway, we employ two pharmacists as well, they don't actually see patients"
HCP," So now yes, we talked about community pharmacists, you know, High Street chemists, they again are doing a lot, a lot of remote work"
HCP," Now, you know, they stepped up on the delivery side, you know, electronic prescriptions delivered rather than people coming into the shop"
HCP," And a lot of them suffered with that, of course, on the retail side, because the retail shops are not being visited"
HCP, And I gather that quite a few of you have gone bankrupt as a consequence
HCP," So the opportunities are reduced for face to face, not just for us, but also other other allied health professionals as well"
KAM,"Yes, which then will have an impact on what you do your health prevention medicine that you're you're delivering for your population as a whole, then"
HCP,yes
HCP," I mean, this is the The Untold Story of the damage COVID has done, isn't it"
HCP," Because, you know, we know, to some extent, how many people have caught it how many people have died"
HCP, But we certainly don't know about what we've missed
HCP," We are seeing as a system, less stroke patients, now, they must still be happening, that they haven't disappeared"
HCP," So our feeling is probably the people with minor strokes just staying away, that they just don't want to go to anywhere near a doctor because they might now catch COVID"
HCP, They don't go near a hospital for the same reason
HCP," So we have restarted our so called cough clinics, including hypertension, diabetes, a with me a management when we restarted everything just just restarted spirometry, although we're slightly worried about using spirometers"
HCP," So yeah, this will be the the studies that have done for the next few years seeing what what's the toll in other non COVID illnesses"
KAM,"And that brings me to the point where, you know, as other surgery what, you know, what are anticoagulation and prevention"
KAM, Do you think there are some new steps you're gonna have to take to meet those challenges
HCP,"I think there's detection is one new step, the way we detect could change"
HCP," I mean, there, there are many apps and indeed these things, you know, I'm wearing a smartwatch"
HCP, Don't tell me if I get sick
HCP," Well, anyway"
HCP," So I think a lot of people will be self diagnosing, you know, there's the one that you can use with mobile phone as well, which is pretty, pretty neat"
HCP," So, you know, those people who are tech savvy, will actually be self diagnosing"
HCP," I think we'll be picking up and we have a low we have 20 or 30, AF devices, you know, the ones you literally Oh, yeah, yeah, in our practice 30 of those, and we're giving those out to people"
HCP," So that ways of protecting which don't involve face to face with a health professional, that will change"
HCP," Pardon me, I think because of the challenges we've already gone through about getting people to into INR clinics with a limited workforce, the switch to NOAC's will will will happen because of constraints on workforce"
KAM,"Yes, yes"
KAM," And it's that I mean, as a, as a as a, with apixaban, you know, you've got that confidence to know that, you know, you are going to prevent more strokes, from your friend, you are going to have less major bleeding and warfarin"
KAM," They don't need to take a substantial meal like they do with rivaroxaban, and they and you've got that 24 hours nice steady state of protection against stroke, particularly with their compliance lips"
KAM, It's not long before they have to take their next one
KAM," You've got those benefits, but but like you say it, it's it's trying to pre empt those challenges of how we can get those patients it sounds like is the PCN you're looking for the detection patient show the vulnerable ones more vulnerable than than the than the warfarin, the ones already on"
KAM, NOAC 's
KAM," So I think I suspect that, that that's going to be the way that medicine, medicine is going to go in the next year is that we've got to really, probably step up and, and concentrate on those detect patients"
HCP,"And yeah, I think if we, if we're being honest, there must be a lot of people out there with AF that we don't know about, particularly intimitent AF"
HCP, And I think that is a concern
HCP," And the more we can get people into, you know, self diagnosis, self monitoring, I mean, I think it has been creeping up for all sorts of things such as, you know, blood sugar and blood pressure anyway"
HCP," But I think this is one of the opportunities if you can dare say that with a pandemic, you know, one on one of the good things about the pandemic is that people are now embracing the idea of remote monitoring, remote consultation"
HCP, And I think there's an opportunity to try to get more and more of these devices out there
HCP," And, you know, either the general practices or indeed hospitals to hand them out, or to encourage people to buy them themselves"
KAM,"Yes, yes, or or pharmacies to have them as well"
KAM, Then come in to pick up a script
KAM, It sounds like you've got the detection
KAM, Really well under way and and within within the within the PCM how the rest of your GPS following  anticoagulation
KAM," Within oxygen what tends to happen is, is there are a few experts within a within a pcn or surgery who can read CCG's better than others or again to is that the same within the"
HCP,"as I was saying earlier, we are a single practice pcn"
HCP, We do have clinical leads in a lot of areas and jokers we used to be called gypsies with an extended roll up called gypsy's GP with special interest but the terms changed
HCP," So, yes"
HCP," And we also by being a single practice PCN we have education meetings, what we did before COVID"
HCP," Anyway, yeah, face to face three, Monday's out of four"
HCP, We don't do that now
HCP, But we have virtual meetings
HCP," So we we always try to attract new GPS, who can be good GPS, of course, but also will bring something extra, whether it be a special interest or an educational role, that that'll get you into our practice, if you're just a good GP and that's it"
HCP," Well, that's not quite enough"
HCP, We're in quite a fortunate position that we've never had vacant spaces
HCP," We've got a waiting list for GPS, which is a bit unusual"
HCP, But it's because of the way we practice general practice and integrated healthcare together that is appealing to GPS is more interesting professional life
HCP," So yes, so we do have leads for anticoagulation we have leads for liaison with the high INR clinic"
HCP," And in terms of our urgent treatment center, our lead ACP, you know, acute care practitioner nurse that has done a master's in thromboembolism and embarrassed to say she knows more about it than I do or any other GP"
HCP," And yeah, absolutely the right person to run our DVT diagnosis and treatment clinic, but, and she also liaises with one of the hematologists, who does an outpatient in one of our buildings, who's very helpful as well"
HCP," So why not, we like to think we're quite well educated"
HCP, And we have good resource within the practice and visiting consultant as well
HCP, So that that's really quite helpful
KAM,"Yes, but I mean, that sounds a fantastic setup"
KAM, I'm definitely not happening that I know of happening here in Oxfordshire
KAM," Sounds, yeah, that it takes having those experts leading in the in the therapy areas"
KAM," And, and, and her challenge must be, you're seeing patients Now then, and what the limits you can do over over well,"
HCP,quite a lot of our colleagues are now moving from full time to one less session full time in order to pursue their interest
HCP, And our model doesn't involve all GP doing the same thing every day
HCP," Our model is about developing a community Integrated Health Care Center, where everybody brings something extra to the table"
HCP, And they're given time to do that
HCP, And a session of doing a clinic is paid the same as a session doing GM's
HCP," And we accept that and respected takes a bit of time getting there because people say, you know, you're going off to play with the train set, and you've been paid the same as me and I'm holding the fort"
HCP, So you have to go through that sort of phase
HCP," But actually, it's extremely good to find that people are stimulated and to have a resource to go to in the practice rather than have to refer someone to outpatients or try to phone up a consultant for a problem that doesn't necessarily need an outpatient department"
HCP," If you've got that resource in the practice, it enriches everyone's life, and we can all bring each other standard up"
KAM,"Yeah, yeah"
KAM, That's something that secondary care can get involved
KAM, It's meeting both in the middle then isn't it
KAM," And and, like you say, if, thankfully, if on Pfizer, you know, if both bought into the same product, which then brings the whole simplicity to anticoagulation"
KAM," It brings that scenario where you know exactly what the drug is going to do, what's going to interact with what what what results you should be getting from it"
KAM," Which, which is why it's use in oxfordshire so that there's no what what what do you do with this drug now, you know, it's a different one than the last the previous patient"
KAM,"I think when you've got PCs, That can meet the secondary care in the middle, it's bringing really good care,"
HCP,it's much more efficient for the patient journey because they don't have to go back and forth to the hospital if you've got a resource you can talk to in the building
HCP," And, you know, the easy cases are easy, but you've got someone with multiple long term conditions, you know, they got renal failure, they might be pregnant, there might be other reasons why it's quite complex"
HCP," So it's actually very helpful to be able to talk to somebody face to face about this, rather than just throw up your hands as a as too difficult if you go to the hematology clinic, which is a shame for the patient"
HCP, And it's a shame for the clinic because it can be dealt with in this different way
KAM,Mm hmm
KAM," Okay, so what what would you need to know from me about the NOAC's or apixaban in particular that would that you don't know already, then"
KAM, You're
HCP,"I mean, you're with respect"
HCP, I'm not sure there is anything big because of the setup I've just described
HCP," Yeah, on site hematologist"
HCP," And on site, ACP, who's got a master's in thromboembolism"
HCP, Yes
HCP," I think I think we're, we're, we're in a pretty good place"
HCP," Some other practices who don't work like this, may well need more information from you"
HCP," But yeah, I don't think that's us"
KAM,That's the impression I'm getting that you You're definitely upsc you're up skilled and knowledgeable
KAM," And everybody is in that position where you, you know, you know, you know exactly what's going to happen, what's required and what you need from it from a NOAC I can and choosing, is fitted, fitted in with that,"
HCP,"you know, it has that showing you you're rather preaching to the converted here, because we found it a useful drug or reliable drug"
HCP," And we're using it as is, east kent hospitals"
HCP," So, you know, it's not as if a patient comes out, you have to switch them from one drug to another, or if they go into hospital, as long as the hospitals switch them to one drug to another, that there's a consistency, which is which is helpful"
KAM,Yes
KAM," And the Do you know what your your percentages sort of use of the lower dose in, you know, your elderly patients moving on to the lower dose those patients will"
HCP,"I'm sorry that will be a question for one of our pharmacists, on"
HCP, I don't know that no
KAM,"Okay, that was all really, I was just going to, I mean, it's, it sounds like if if I worked up in your area, it would be providing all the patient resources for those who are here for the nurse and that sort of thing and checking that they've got everything they needed, or a apixaban patient in that area"
KAM, And that sort of those ongoing educational pieces that we can bring to support support
KAM, Its used rarely
KAM, And
HCP,"yes, I mean, Pfizer have supported some of our educational meetings by bringing a consultant in, and quite often that that will not just be a lecture, it'll be a question and answer session about cases, you know, in a case discussion, or someone who, you know, doesn't fit the bill of being a fit patient that you can put a stamp on a standard dose"
HCP, So it's actually very helpful and that sort of support as been useful to us
KAM,"Hmm, yeah"
KAM, Great
KAM, Okay
HCP,Okay
KAM,"Well, thank your time, it's been incredibly interesting"
KAM," And I will be, I'll be using your example of your surgery to the surgery we have in in Chipping Norton, we're very keen to develop a system like yours, I think working with secondary care, and they already have an cardiovascular outreach program where other GPS can referring to it"
KAM," But I think they definitely want to go towards towards your, your,"
HCP,"it's a good model, and it has the added advantage that you can attract GPS and other health care professionals into it because they want to work in it"
HCP, So it has taken us a couple of decades to deliver to the extent we have
HCP, So you're not gonna do it overnight
HCP," But, you know, to try and add a couple of new services every year and keep going"
HCP, It's a lovely way of working
KAM,Yeah
KAM," very fulfilling, I'm sure"
KAM," Okay, great"
HCP,All right
HCP," Well, nice speaking to Jessica"
KAM,"Bye,"
HCP,bye
