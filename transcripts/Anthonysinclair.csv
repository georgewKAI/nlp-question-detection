KAM,So how are you keeping Mohsin
HCP,Not bad
HCP, How are you
KAM,"Yeah, not too bad"
KAM, Thank you
HCP,Where are you based at the moment
KAM,I'm based in
KAM," I'm in Luton, but I cover the area that I cover is hertfordshire, Bedfordshire"
KAM, north and so on
KAM, Yeah
HCP,Fair enough big patch
KAM,Yeah
KAM, So big area
KAM, So you're in Darby Mohsin are
HCP,correct
HCP, Yes
KAM,Okay
KAM, Okay
KAM," So your your your principal pharmacist,"
HCP,"she had lead pharmacists for high cost drugs, Home Care medical transition and formulary"
KAM,Okay
KAM, Okay
KAM," And thus Mohsin is that for, like you said, home care"
KAM, Home Care
HCP,"Yes, that's one of the things in my portfolio Yes"
KAM,"Oh, I see"
KAM, Okay
KAM, Okay
KAM," Um, Mohsin How, how have COVID"
KAM, How has it affected
KAM, Your colleagues and so on within the hospital
KAM," Because it's been quite devastating, obviously, around the UK"
HCP,"Yeah, absolutely"
HCP," I think first wave was everyone was really motivated to help, you know, we're gonna come together and things are quite well, but the NHS service no longer existed in the first wave"
HCP, It was just a children
HCP, COVID service
HCP, Yeah
HCP," So we stopped all outpatient activity, active surgery"
HCP, It was Yeah
HCP," So we were purely focused, and everyone was driven and, you know, the population, the people, they really adhere to the lockdown initially"
HCP," Okay, second wave has been disastrous, in my opinion, is really have been bad"
HCP," So, you know, people haven't been taken seriously"
HCP, So we've had massive spikes
HCP," We had to add a trust, maintainn our patient services, elective surgery, which again, was a challenge"
HCP, Yeah
HCP, Because you just got reduced capacity
HCP," And then in terms of the workforce, which was the biggest thing for me"
HCP, Yeah
HCP, People lost the motivation and emotion was gone
HCP,We had colleagues pretty severely air colleagues passing away
HCP," Yeah, children at school, other schools close now"
HCP, It was just an absolute mess
HCP," And it's just, it still is really difficult at work"
HCP," You know, we can't decide our roter until nine o'clock in the morning because we every day, we know something's gonna happen"
KAM,I see
KAM, Okay
KAM," Yeah, yeah"
KAM, Yeah
KAM, Yeah
KAM," You guys are doing a brilliant job, but it is"
KAM, So it's such a strange thing
KAM," I never ever, ever thought in my lifetime, I would obviously lived through a pandemic, you know what I mean"
KAM," And so, it is, you know, it's so uprooted everything I would imagine, you know, so it's good that you and your colleagues are doing okay, but, you know, I'm hoping I'm really hoping that it comes to an end sooner rather than later"
KAM," So, honestly, definitely, so Mohsin and tell me a little bit more of your role"
KAM, So is it more do you see patients or do you manage a group of pharmacists
HCP,"So I manage a team I, I no longer see, or I, I'm not involved in direct patient care anymore"
HCP," Okay, right"
HCP," Unless I'm covering for somebody, which has been quite regularly recently, but generally not on the wards not seeing patients in clinics, etc"
HCP, Even though I'm a non medical prescriber
HCP," I don't, I don't I don't see patients anymore"
HCP," So what I'm involved is mainly project work formulary work guidelines, and then managing services and managing parts of our home care, home care service"
HCP," Okay, having conversations with our commissioners around, you know, STP work ICS work, Formulary, what's going on primary care what's going on secondary care"
HCP, It's it's quite wide ranging
KAM,"Okay, okay"
KAM, Yeah
KAM, So I cover Yes
KAM," So, within the hospital, and I see a lot of and I cover apixaban for atrial fibrillation"
KAM, I also do another drug for amyloid cardiomyopathy
KAM," You know, and so, please, how does, how do you in terms of formulary decision"
KAM, How does you got How do you guys decide what gets into the formula and so on
HCP,So it depends on different pathways
HCP," So see if there's a NICE advice on, we have no choice"
HCP, We have to get it onto the formulary
HCP, Yeah
HCP, We'll talk about patients
HCP," Yeah, well, we have more than one option to put up within DOACs, you know, your license for AF"
HCP," You know, we have that conversation with our clinicians"
HCP," Okay, we have conversations with yourself with your MSL potentially, with the evidence"
HCP," But especially within the doac carrier, I find like the I mean, the evidence, it is what it is, but it's not head to head, it's never going to be you can't compare the data for revenue expenditure"
HCP," So you're looking at safety, but from my experience, I let our clinicians dictate what they want and their real life experience Trumps all the data that you can present to them"
HCP," Yeah, and they have extensive experience"
HCP," You know, I remember the days where we just had to pick a trend and then as you know, rivaroxaban came and then apixaban came and then now we've got adoxaban as well"
HCP," Yeah, they all have different profiles, you know, different patients are suitable for different things"
HCP," I'll give you an example of my own my own father, although he's taking it for prophylaxis of DVT"
HCP," Apixaban was chosen for him, but actually in Ramadan, when he's fasting for 15 hours of the day"
HCP," Yeah, it's the apixaban work for him"
HCP," So we change him over to rivaroxaban for that whole month, so again different patient to do things"
HCP," So essentially, the guideline, the policy formula decisions are dictated by the clinicians"
HCP, Yeah
HCP,"And then in terms of what input I would have, is actually speaking to our primary care clinics, actually, a few guys are going to continue this, what's your opinion"
HCP, What do you want to say
HCP, Okay
HCP," And then I will do the cost analysis with the commission and see what's, what's the burden gonna be, you know, we might be might have a discounted price for initiating patients, but then if it's a higher cost in primary care, because we're looking more closely together now, we haven't have those conversations"
KAM,"Sure, sure"
KAM, Okay
KAM, Yeah
KAM, And you're absolutely right
KAM, It's about finding the right medicines for the right patients
KAM, And it's all about the patient
KAM," You know, so we do focus a lot on what's best for the patient, so to speak, you know"
HCP,Yeah
HCP," So again, just to add there, so in our trust trust policy, is that doxapan is first line"
HCP," Okay, but that doesn't mean that we will not allow patients to have something else if the clinician deems it appropriate"
HCP, Yeah
HCP," And I was really, you know, I was the commissioners didn't agree with that"
HCP, I was really adamant that that was going to be the case
HCP, Yeah
HCP,So okay
HCP, It's a balancing act
HCP, Yeah
HCP," So,"
KAM,"so Mohsin, when you see representatives as myself"
KAM," What is it that you you look for what is it they, What type of information"
KAM," Or you know, what type of, for instance, support can we give you in order to get the best out of our service"
HCP,"For me, it's all about education"
HCP, Right
HCP," So you know, initially when we have a conversation, and let's just say apixaban is new drug, you're going to give me what information I need"
HCP, You're going to give me data
HCP, Yeah
HCP," You can potentially arrange me to speak to you MSL you're gonna what really interests me is evidence, new evidence, new licenses, which you know, all the ducks have been going through new licenses"
HCP, Yeah
HCP, Holding educational sessions for my junior pharmacists
HCP," Okay, you'll get an up to speed"
HCP," So we have something in our trust to use before COVID came twice weekly lunchtime education sessions, where we gave a 20 minute slot to pharma"
HCP," Yeah, got it"
HCP, Yeah
HCP," And they bought three food, which is always helpful"
HCP, Yeah
HCP, Yeah
HCP," And then the rest of the 40 minutes, we don't have conversation about what we just described without the agenda"
HCP, So we used to do that certification in that sense
HCP," But I think the secondary thing that's come about after COVID is, you know, using experts within the NHS to teach with the colleagues in the NHS, so hosting seminars, seminars, afterwork seminars online, where you know, an expert in doacs or hematology somewhere"
HCP," Yeah, you guys would procure for them to develop for, you know, an educational topic"
KAM,Yeah
KAM, Yeah
KAM," Because and you're absolutely right, we do do a lot of that in terms of providing education"
KAM," It could be, you can meet and bring in, it could be a consultant within your trust, or whatever, to give a talk around a certain specific area, just interest of interest to you guys, you know what I mean"
KAM," And so, um, there's a, there's another thing that we have, also, that you may find interesting, and it's, it's a, it's a site that we have, and it's strictly for healthcare professionals"
KAM, It's called Pfizer Pro
KAM," And so if you have to go with the air register, put in the information and put in a create a password and everything on there Mohsin, what you'll find, there's a lot of information around all Pfizer medicines, and vaccines is a lot of information also gives you you can actually, now you can speak directly with a representative or even put information in there, and a representative will come back to you and get you the right information that you may require"
KAM, It could be around any drug or whatever
KAM," Also, there's a lot of patient information in there"
KAM," So free stuff for patients, but you can find some information on there for patients"
KAM," And also a lot of materials, educational materials"
KAM," For instance, if you wanted to sign up or register for a Pfizer meeting that's coming up, it could be a month or two away"
KAM," And here, your team even attend to those meetings"
KAM, They're quite good
KAM," And even videos, there are videos on there that you can print"
KAM, You want lunch meetings within with your team around a certain area
KAM," So these are peer to peer Expert videos that are on the site that you can actually, you know, run with you even so on"
KAM, So it's quite good actually
HCP,Sounds quite interesting and that It's quite useful actually
KAM,"Yeah, yeah, definitely"
KAM," It's, it's called you could go there is Pfizer Pro, is Pfizer Pro"
KAM, Co
KAM,uk
KAM, So you can always go there and sign up and register
KAM," And, you know, it will ask you, if you're a healthcare professional initially, when you go into the site, you say yes"
KAM," And then in the right hand corner, there's information, you just register with the site"
KAM, Good
KAM, Yeah
KAM," Yeah, definitely"
KAM, Definitely
KAM," So, um, so what what other type of Do you mostly focus because I was looking at some information on the pharmaceutical journal, and he says, is the most the high cost medicines that you focus on"
KAM,Corret Yeah
KAM, Yeah
KAM," So my, when I first first qualified when I did my prescribing course, I did it on"
KAM, anticoagulation AF
KAM, Yeah
KAM," And now that since developed now, I'm supposed to be an expert in biologics and most of my life, but all of it higher cost drugs"
KAM, So my portfolio is mainly high cost drugs and psychology appraisals and NICE and that kind of stuff
KAM,"Okay, okay"
KAM, Okay
KAM," So, um, so, in terms of my construct, so you make a decision in terms of a higher cost drug comes down to the, within the system within, within the formulary"
HCP,It's more the management of that process
HCP," So a high cost drug will have a nice technology appraisal, or it's gonna have an NHS England specialist commissioning policy document, which means that we can use it"
HCP," Yeah, then it's just a case of, you know, having a procurer with prices and gears, who's going to supply it because actually, the trustworthy suppliers can go buy a home care or maybe not patient is it bundled or unbundled the homecare offering the PSP, then there's the management of high cost drugs"
HCP," So remember, the commissioners are paying for these drugs"
HCP," So on that cost, they want the assurance that the right patients are getting these drugs that might involve new tech or might involve audit work might involve engagement clinical teams, and then in the back of that you've got biosimilars coming out"
HCP," Now, let's switch to patient that's a whole consenting process, the management of that, okay, it's quite, it's not the fact that we're putting down to the formulary or the decision process of putting in the formulary, it's more the whole management around that"
HCP," But then on top of that, what also, what time takes is kind of deciding where it's going to fall in the pathway looks patients, right, okay"
HCP," They know, 10 options for the same indication, you have to offer them more legally"
HCP," But actually, we can't give everyone access to everything"
HCP, So we have an algorithm where the cost effectiveness content
KAM,"Yeah, yeah"
KAM, Okay
KAM," So and also you do, you do a little bit of commissioning, also, from from what I read"
KAM, So that involves a lot within your workload
HCP,"So high cost durgs, commissioning economy is synonymous, but we also look at some of the contracts for the services that we have"
HCP,So I get some input in that
HCP, And then some of the conditions
HCP," For example, an ophthalmologist wants to, you know, deliver a new clinic for AMD, then I would be supporting him and discussing that with the commissioners, and the commissioners in NHS England"
HCP," essentially, what the service what quite what requirements how do we do it into the population, just to put the impact analysis, that kind of stuff"
KAM,"Okay, okay"
HCP,So quite broad
KAM,"job description, isn't it"
HCP,The job description is as brief as you can get
HCP, I think I've just kind of spread my wings a little bit
HCP, Too much
KAM,Okay
KAM, Okay
KAM," So that I would imagine it keeps you very busy, though"
KAM, I would imagine
KAM, Yeah
HCP,"Yeah, it was it wasn't because I'm an insomniac"
HCP, It kind of works quite well
KAM,I can imagine
KAM, Yeah
KAM, Okay
KAM," So, um, so, yeah, but like you said, Now, you don't really see a lot of patients"
KAM," So, you know, but then obviously, you do influence your team"
KAM, So a lot of your team members will go that to that level
KAM, See all our patients on our I would imagine
KAM," Yeah, yeah, correct"
KAM, Okay
KAM, Okay
KAM," So, so, yeah, um, in regards to Yeah, as I mentioned, in terms of anticoagulation, or apixaban for AF, you know, like said, there's no head to head date or anything like that"
KAM," But we also have a lot of an excellent reward data for apixaban, which is, you know, which would be quite useful, you know, for you and your team in order to, you know, to know, you know, when presenting or deciding on what to use for the patients and so on, you know,"
HCP,"yeah, yeah"
HCP, So we will detail as to factory
HCP," I don't know, I don't look at initial trials and phase two, phase three, but you have to enter some new drug but I'm not really that interested in that data"
HCP, What I'm interested in is real life will be worth data
HCP," And that's where I think you got the differentiation and safety profiles and efficacy in different demographics, you get an idea"
HCP," Yeah, it's just so yeah, it's just so useful"
HCP, And it gives you a massive insight into the decisions that you're making
HCP," Absolutely, yeah,"
KAM,"absolutely, you definitely see exactly how the drug is, you know, randomized control trials are very good"
KAM," But the reward data will give you a real life experience in terms of what's going on, and and how effective the drug is, and how the patients are responding to that drug, also, and also, a lot of it is quite independently"
KAM, So you have a lot of independence in regards to some data on your data
KAM," So I would imagine, it would be quite useful"
HCP,"Yeah, absolutely"
HCP, Independent data is pretty good
HCP," The issue is, we look at you and the data that you present with us as we treat like the enemy"
HCP," I don't know why it is just, it's just built into us"
HCP," We'll go, you can't necessarily sell the drug to us, of course, you want to present it in the best way"
HCP, Absolutely
HCP, Yeah
HCP," It's just, this seems to be this kind of obstacle in believing"
KAM,"I've spoken to people and they've said to me in the past, you guys pick the best of your data, and show it to me"
KAM,"So they think we're, you know, we pick the best of everything, and just pick out the cherry picking a lot of ways, which we don't we pretty much put everything out there"
KAM," You know, when showing the data, and by then that's where real data comes in"
KAM," And it you know, because every you know, a lot of it is peer reviewed"
KAM, So it's for apixaban
KAM," It's really, really, really good"
HCP,I agree
HCP, I think
HCP, I think it expands great
HCP, I think my dad takes it for example
HCP," Yeah, agreed"
HCP, They're just they're just this perception of negativity towards any data that's given to us in that way
KAM,Yeah
KAM, which is unfortunate
KAM," You know,"
HCP,it is it is unfortunate
HCP," And it's something that we're taught as undergraduates, you know, how to critically appraise data that's presented to you"
HCP," Yeah, it builds into your mind this idea that actually everything is just a means of false promotion"
HCP," But I think to an extent, I I don't disagree with them"
HCP, Yeah
HCP," If you are, you know, competent in interpreting that data, and you spent time around people, you know, how to critically appraise it"
HCP," Yeah, you can you get the gist of what's going on"
HCP, Absolutely
KAM,"Yeah, absolutely"
KAM, Yeah
KAM, Yeah
KAM," And there's different forms, obviously, of data to look at and interpret"
KAM, And so you're absolutely right
KAM," And, you know, and there are some people that do cherry pick certain things, do you mean that so you have to be able to see you again, get a good idea"
KAM," And he and struck a palace in regards to, um, you know, what was the real outcome i would say"
HCP,yeah
HCP, I think the one thing that really is a pet hate of mine is when you have a slide with apixabans data showing the efficacy
HCP, Yeah
HCP, And the slide that follows that we'll have one of your competitors data
HCP," Yeah, I will say you can't make a direct comparison, because a BPO, wont allow you yours just not allowed to do that"
HCP," Doesn't imply comparison, but actually been understood is an entirely different population is there's so many different factors to take into consideration"
HCP," Yeah, it's a personal pet hate of mine"
KAM,"I think in a lot of ways, to right"
KAM," It's their data we have, it's kind of like we're showing what their data is saying, as opposed to, it's not us saying that we just showing what they're indeed, their own data showing"
KAM," And we're just comparing it to ours and to say, what our data showing you know what i mean"
KAM, So as opposed to us being one sided
KAM, And just showing everything that we have on our side You know what i mean
KAM, And I think that's more or less it
KAM, I would say
KAM," Yeah,"
HCP,yeah
HCP, I'm sure I'm sure we can debate this all day
KAM,Mohsin
KAM, Thank you very much
KAM, Let's
KAM," Yeah,"
HCP,"hopefully, the weather is a bit brighter in your mind, because,"
KAM,"unfortunately, not it's not"
KAM, I think it's supposed to rain all weekend too
KAM, So I don't think it's gonna get any better than it is right now
KAM," You know, looking forward to the spring day"
HCP,Yeah
HCP, Okay
HCP, Anthony Pleasure as always
KAM,pleasure
KAM," Mine also listen, you and your staff"
KAM, Keep safe
KAM, Okay
HCP,Thank you much
HCP, All right
HCP, Bye
HCP, Bye
HCP, Bye
